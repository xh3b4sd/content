LONG NIGHT

it was a long night
two in the morning
it's been a long time
only you and me

it will be just fine
don't you worry
this is the good life
with everything we need

and everything you see
was made for you and me
and you are the only
sharing my destiny

it is darkest before dawn
and I wouldn't change it

only you and me
it's been a long time
