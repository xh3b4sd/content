Most #people don't know what to do with their #lives. They don't have a
#purpose. In fact, nobody has any in the first place, but we find out as we
#move forward. And this is the #important part to #understand. You find out as
you are getting along. You cannot arrive anywhere with the single first step.
You have to break it down and #iterate through it until you are there. And you
will #arrive. And if not maybe the way was just the #goal the whole #time.
