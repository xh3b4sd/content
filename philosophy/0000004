The #system is not perfect. It neither is #unfair. It is the best we came up
with so far. Try to #improve it and be it the small things. #devil is in the
details only when you let them go. When you give everything, you will get what
you deserve. #whining about what others got or why things happen you cannot
change will not bring anybody further. Going off the system will not bring
anybody further. Hijacking the system will make you lonely and bitter. Play the
system instead and find your way.
