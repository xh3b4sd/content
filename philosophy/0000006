When you do not know what to do, you just need to do something. No matter how
neglectable it seems to be. Just keep #moving. Doing a step in the #dark brings
you forward irrespectable of the actual direction you are going to. You find new
ways by #walking the #walk. This is #discovery of your #destiny and your own
self. Like the #real one and not the #fake #shit you pretend all day.
