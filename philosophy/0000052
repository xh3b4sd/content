There is an objective spectrum of #tolerance to everything we do. The objective
spectrum has an subjective counterpart for each #individual. We #live a
#balanced #life when both spectrums align. I assume #nobody achieves this,
because we are individuals.

How far our balance is off determines how #pathological we are. Now how to make
sense of these #theories? Why does it even work out for us to be out of balance?
Because it works out.

You are #friend and #enemy in the same #person and everything that is holding
you back from #improving is your #ego. You must be willing to #ask the right
#questions and you must be willing to #accept the #answers even if this means
you were wrong your whole #life.

This is then one of the #hardest #challenges you may #experience and at this
point it decides who you really are. When you go one step further, be it only a
very small one. The move you make brings the #change you need to #master the
#obstacle and be better off in the #future.

Once you have #realized this #idea and once it #sparked a #light #inside of you,
you can #repeat it and from here you #become #unstoppable. Now look on what you
can achieve over a couple of #years with nothing but some #microroutine and a
bit of #consistency in your #behaviour.
