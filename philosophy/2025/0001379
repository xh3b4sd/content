Believing your own thoughts is, more often than not, effectively keeping your
world smaller than you deserve, if only you would just be a little more brave to
challenge your own assumptions.

But doing that is scary, and so most people don't, living in a smaller world
that they then try to keep small for themselves, and others. Don't believe
everything you keep telling yourself. Life is not about not fearing, but about
to be real brave.
