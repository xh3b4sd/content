There come #times in which everything #changes. So #overwhelming. So many new
#horizons. So many new #questions to #answer. The #world becomes a new one. A
#strange one. You have to find a way. #your #way. Nothing is like it was before
and you just try to sort it. For yourself, and no matter how #hard you try it
will never be good enough. #keep #grinding though.
