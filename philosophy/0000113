#life is a #hot #bath #tube. It is really really hot and you #intuitively lean
out a leg or two and at best your arms as well because it is way more
#comfortable #dealing #with the #heat.

But in order to #kickoff the full #potential of your immune system you have to
put up with the heat and go full into again. You have to #force #yourself to #do
the damn #right #thing. Life is a hot bath tube.
