When you meet boring #people you meet people who are #insecure around you. Might
be your #fault but most likely not. Make sure you are not the boring one and get
to the core of your #insecurities. Ask the real questions. When #life is easy
you are doing it wrong. So get your act together and be fun to be around and
just tell people what the fuck you think. Nothing is more valuable than being
#honest from the bottom of your #heart.
