When the #game feels #unfair your #emotions can carry you away real quick. Once
shit hit the fan and you dropped out, you need some time to get your act
together. Get back in the game. You have to anyway. Be it one game, or the
other. Driving change according to your reflection brings you #back to #life.
You have to #walk the walk. Walk the walk.
