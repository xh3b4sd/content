We live in #societies that deal with #individual #failure like this. Once you
make a #mistake, you are an #idiot. You dared to make a step forward and you
#failed #miserably. You should be #ashamed of yourself and your presence should
be wiped from the surface of the #planet.

We should never ever #talk about it and better keep everything as it is because
it just works out somehow staying #lethargic within the status quo. Now this
leads to #people being #afraid of #experimenting and moving forward. It makes
them afraid of asking #questions.

Afraid of asking the right questions. Afraid of #exploring who they really are
and who they want to be. And they stop caring. They inherent their pathologies
to the environment. Our failure #culture has to be redefined. We should become
#brave and dare to ask the right questions.

We must be #willing to #accept their true answers and simply #thrive from there.
It isn't a bad thing to make a mistake, but it certainly is to not talk about it
and to not #learn from it in the #future.
