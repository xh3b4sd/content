You are who you are, as of now. You can be different in the #next #moment. You
have the #potential to become better, or worse, as you proceed. You decide in
which #direction you go. Now, when a lot of things play together, you can #be
#anything. This might be #good or #bad.

You decide for #good or #bad. You decide with #practice. So whatever you do
manifests itself #inside of #you. The good things and the bad things. What did
you do good today? Ask yourself. What did you do bad today? Hold on for a minute
to get to that point. It is inside of you.

Which #bad #habits did manifest inside of you? How long did you practice them?
Are you #happy with yourself? Are you happy with the #world around you? What are
you doing to #bring #change? That you cannot change anything is not true. You
can just #start #with #yourself.
