It just happens that #you #are #wrong about something. You usually don't #notice
it. This is where a lot of #challenge comes from because others do notice your
#failure.

Take the #opportunity of finding out what is more right, #together. We all can
#benefit so much from it, just by #acknowledging that we are wrong at times and
appreciating the opportunity to #learn in order to become #better.
