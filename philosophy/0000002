Earning #money does not mean to do something you #hate. Go for what makes you
#happy. There are plenty of #opportunities for most of #us. Your frame of
reference is what counts and what determines your #priorities. Set the frame
right. Tune your agenda. Ask the real questions and once you start discovering
new horizons #happiness comes along.
