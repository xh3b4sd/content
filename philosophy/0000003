There will come a #time in which #problems arise that seem to be too #big to
overcome. It will hit you. It will happen. No matter who you are. No matter
what you are doing. No matter how tough you think you are. It will happen and
take you down. You better be prepared for this. Prepare for this. Like #now.
Stop taking the shortcut all the time. Go long or go #home.
