how it is to be the only shadow in the morning light,
how it is to be the only whisper in the darkest night,
how it is I think of you so often that just breathing hurts,
how it is to spend the night just writing down my needy thoughts,

how it is to miss you so, how it is to almost cry,
how it is to know it will forever be so dark insight,
how it is to understand, how it is to look away,
how it is to not be good for you no matter what you say,

how it is to need a friend, how it is to feel the end,
how it is the colours of the sky make me to see again,
how it is between us, and somehow it is really cool,
let it be what people do, what we both have is beautiful,

how it is I show you this and you know what it really means,
how it is you just freak out because you do things like these,
how it is that there is nothing like the perfect timing,
let it be and fly, when you just feel like flying,
