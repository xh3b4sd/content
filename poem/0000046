I have a little thing for you and I want that you take it,
fast forward with my little heart, say can you feel it shaking?,
with a thousand miles between us, I am like that tattooed bracelet,
when I am running out of words for you, I feel so fucking naked,

whatever may be out there making your heart sad and cry out,
we can be naked together and leave everything behind now,
it is dark there where I come from, people always fighting my crown,
at some point I'm breaking out there and just try to write my mind down,

let me get this straight here, I am your poet from the street,
inked to my arm back then is the poem of my dreams,
back then in this other life were lots of broken dreams,
what a dream to be with you together and just folding sheets,

come with me and figure out, if this thing really real is,
be the poem of my dreams, I am craving just one real kiss,
all this shit insight of me and what I have to deal with,
all I need is what I dreamed of, dreamed of kissing you to heal it,

this thought of you at midnight, that excitement of what happens,
my breath soft on your skin makes your heart stop for a second,
you come like a weapon seeing you in these tight leggings,
your legs tight all around my own is like to be in heaven,

you know that little feeling, when your hand fits just in mine,
our fingers chained together, little sweaty from that night,
you dance and I am with you, my cheeks teasing your thigh,
finally your body shaking, like you shaking my whole life,

tell me where you want to be with me in forty years,
I can tell it doesn't matter just as long you love me real,
when it rains I call you sunshine, kiss away your salty tears,
I like you like to call me handsome, like you kill off all my fears,

and when you really want to, want this here is not the end,
you can just give me your hand and we build castles out of sand,
taking care of you, care of your baby, our land,
doing what it needs to be together, doing what I can,
