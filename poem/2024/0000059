finding every flame
every glow of every sunset
pretty faces heavy rain
in longing so enchanted

the blood lines of horizons
no victim of such pretty crime
no beast no god no titan
may ever be too proud to cry

cause this is what we ought to be
the colours of a frozen sky
dancing 'cross the seven sees
in gales of love my moon to shine
