sometimes when I let you go
the dark inside me really turns
sometimes I just miss you so
so bad that just breathing hurts

you know I have this fantasy
and nothing that I want so bad
it's not like you were meant for me
but we have what nobody has

nothing like these memories
when you could barely reach my hand
cause you became the melody
no one can hear, except I can
