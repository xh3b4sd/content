when you read this, I am gone
cause the wind came back to take me
may you hear me in a song
that you like to listen lately

look up to the night sky
know I am back home again
know that I am better now
know that this is not the end

tell them I found meaning here
go and tell of all mankind
tell them of that secret, dear
that they carried all that time
