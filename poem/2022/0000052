pain is what you leave behind
what actually ought to be yours
pain is what you feel at night
in absence of a higher cause

pain for reaching next to me
into the cold part of my bed
pain for being desperately
so lonely but insight my head

pain holding you in my arms
the warmth of your sweet scent in lust
pain holding an empty heart
just slowly cracking into dust

pain that makes me scream insight
until my voice is gone for good
pain that makes you lose your smile
that I thought you never could

pain for writing this for you
and knowing that you do not want
pain for loving me so too
knowing that you really don't

and then there is this simple pain
things that I could never do
dancing in the pouring rain
being there and loving you
