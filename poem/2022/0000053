more than you can fathom,
for this light no one can see,
the fire of a dragon,
burning deep inside of me,

less than what you wish for,
cannot all be what you need,
takes a kiss to burn together,
for this dream to be complete,

hoping for tomorrow,
for today never be coming,
though we may come together,
because together we are stunning,
