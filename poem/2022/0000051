I know I am still bleeding
darkness slowly turning black
still cannot shake that feeling
you deserve way more than that

looking for a mirror
where I see my own smile
looking for a broken heart
heal it for a little while

let us be that moment
never running out of life
we can be this second thought
that I have a thousand times

let us be that dreamer
dreaming of you every night
we can make this second wish
that I come to peace inside

let us be that feeling
looking for your pretty smile
this now is the reason
I know who we are tonight

I just want to take your hand
take your hand and dance with you
just another chance with you
dancing in the glancing moon

I know I am still bleeding
what I feel is like a secret
long forgotten but not healing
nothing left but broken pieces
