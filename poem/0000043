I understand and I can feel you, it is ok to be afraid,
the world in which we live in, is a really frightening place,
being better tomorrow, we all share the same fate,
life is not about not fearing, but about to be real brave,

as we wander, as we play, as our puzzles come to life,
we enjoy, we friend, we love, everything feels kind of right,
as we fall, and as we lose, as our day turns into night,
we hate, we hurt, we lie, and some go to the sky,

you are out there in the dark, asking who you are,
a thousand mirror pieces, tears fill now your heart,
I don't know what happened, but I know it's in the past,
we both are here now, and I have a slipper made of glass,

just try if it may fit, and if it doesn't I will leave,
leave where I might belong to, free you from that piece,
of the puzzle I don't fit into, and do not seem to be,
I am there for what you feel, I am there when it is me,

when we fight we fight together, what I do when you call,
when we cry we cry together, what I do when we might fall,
all my passion, all my love, all I am, all I stand for,
give me your hand, we give it meaning, from dusk until the dawn,
