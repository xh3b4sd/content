running far, going nowhere,
I am a legion on your side,
when the devil comes to get you,
I haunt him back in time,

holding on, waiting hours,
I am with you every night,
when the bad dreams come to get you,
I turn dark into light,

standing up, rising steady,
I am the sun in your blue sky,
when the rain falls come to get you,
my kiss just makes you smile,

I don't mind the water,
and the cold is an old friend,
when I walk, I walk through fire,
our promise, our land,

when the real life comes to get you,
under frozen peach horizons,
in light of the second sun,
whatever comes, we're fighting,
