only got this heart to lose
just to be a part of you
come this rainy afternoon
you and me the darker truth

when your touch was bending time
never understanding why
lips like there's a dancing sky
kiss me just for ending mine

picture you and think the same
white like just the winter came
sometimes is the wind the way
even if it brings the rain
