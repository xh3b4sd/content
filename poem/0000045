closing eyes, see in the dark,
lost in times, lost in this heart,
listen, don't get me wrong,
missing, listening to that wild song,

your hand in the rain,
you running through my vein,
your heart, your smile, your song uh,
I wish I could belong to,

make me king, make me crown,
master kingdom, dark my throne
every thing, just falls to dust,
cause we are yet not brave enough,

a touch, a simple smile,
that kind of hard to find,
falling day and falling night,
feel the pain, a broken life,

and yet, my closing eyes,
and yet, keep losing time,
yet listen, keep it missing,
falling day through falling night,

nobody should be with you,
when I'm lonely here and miss you,
online in the wrong place,
still playing all these lost games,

I want every thing,
could I paint it I would do,
I am too afraid the truth,
is I am not good for you,
