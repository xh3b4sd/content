out there only darkness,
lonely, cold and heartless,
dusty, old and worn out,
bumpy on your own ground,

it does not really matter,
what you have or how your name is,
it is way way more important,
what you do and how you say it,

every day should be like,
just holding your hand,
my heart is with the night sky,
whispering your name again,

it does not really matter,
where you are or if it's fair,
it is way way more important,
who is with you and takes care,

every day should be like,
in slow motion on your shoulder,
my heart is with the night sky,
hear your whisper coming closer,

it does not really matter,
at some point you really feel it,
my heart is with the night sky,
treat it careful like a secret,

far away from me and hopeless,
and I cannot really change that,
I can feel you in these moments,
hold you tight and love you naked,
