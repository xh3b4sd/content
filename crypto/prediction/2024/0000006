Eigenlayer will enable co-processors

Restaking was a big narrative in 2023 and next year we are going to see
applications of it onchain. I believe restaking of ETH can become a pivotal
moment for all of DeFi given the multitide of infrastructure related
applications are going to be enabled. Not only will EigenDA compete with
Celestia and other Data Availability providers, but on top of that Eigenlayer
will allow co-processor networks to form to help with MEV solutions,
decentralized sequencers and other proving systems in conjunction with fancy ZK
witchcraft to help scale Ethereum and help Rollups become better products
themselves.
