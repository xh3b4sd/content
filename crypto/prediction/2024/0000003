SOL will not flip ETH

In fact nobody will flip anyone. Solana as an ecosystem will develop further and
become a household name throughout the industry next to Bitcoin and Ethereum.
But all the gambling and zero fees at the speed of light will not be enough for
SOL to grow a market cap past ETH in 2024. Short term Solana has the narrative
but the math for the network's profitability and thus sustainability does not
seem to checkout and that fact will remain to be true in 2024 and beyond. We
have yet to see some major hacks on Solana and the rampant effects on MEV on its
user base. Selling MEV as a plus for the chain will only work out long term if
MEV can be captured and redistributed in sustainable ways without screwing over
all the users. We have not seen anything yet from that dark forest and while we
wait for something successful that can only be build on Solana, we are also
awaiting effects of all the hidden lowsoycrusaders of that ecosystem. I would
encourage everyone to take a look at the Tokenterminal financial statements to
understand what's happening here.
