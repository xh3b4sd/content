Total crypto marketcap will not break 5T

The two top use cases for crypto are gambling and unruggable money. We are doing
both today as an industry, but we are not very good at making those two
particularly easy to use. The barrier to entry is too high and the concequences
of incompetence way too unforgiving still. While we have a chance of doubling
the total crypto market cap from where we are today, we are not going to break
through 5 Trillion in 2024. If we should run into a value capturing phenomenon
that has a higher halflife of two weeks, all bets are off on this metric, but
based on the little we know today, there won't be anything meaningfully
different to play with in 2024. That is not to say that we are making strides in
all directions. But while 2024 might be the year of meaningful onchain gaming,
the 10x revelation to change everything is not likely to hit the coming year,
because so much fundamental work is still being done. Leaning out of the window
here a bit, one prediction I am super hyped about for 2025 is truly onchain
poker, which would be able to disrupt the existing intransparent Web2 baed
industry and bring in a lot of new entrants. But due to technological
requirements and feasability issues, this has to wait for another calendar year.
