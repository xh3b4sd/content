Account abstraction brings more Web2 like experiences

With better tooling and service providers around the concept of account
abstraction the industry's products start to become appealing for the average
user of the internet. There is still too much unpleasant friction in today's
dApps and account abstraction like primitives start to improve on that frontier,
which is acutely necessary to say the least. We will start to enable more layers
of security and account recovery and in 2024, more than in any year prior, will
likely lay the foundation for massive user adoption of crypto related products
world wide moving towards 2030. One year at a time.
