BTC does not break through 100k

Everyone expected 2023 to be rather bleak. Everyone was warning about the big
recession hitting any moment. 2023 turned out to be rather successful for
financial markets. Now everyone expects 2024 to be a banger and chances are it
will not be quite that either. Everyone is waiting for the Bitcoin ETF approval
by January 10th. Estimates of 10B - 20B of yearly inflows are projected for the
Spot Bitcoin ETF products. Those inflows would be a marginal improvement in
liquidity conditions. Once the ETF narrarive played out in the speculative
aspects of the markets, there is only the BTC halving left alongside rate cuts
in 2024. The halving might not have enormous effects anymore structurally at
this point, and interest rates will not be lowered dramatically in 2024. BTC
might as well double throughout the coming year but it will most likely not
break through 100k USD per BTC in 2024.
