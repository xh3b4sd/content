ETH will not break through 6k

Ethereum's narratives are positioned between Bitcoin's and Solana's along many
relevant dimensions. Notably those are the cost of usage, the guaranteed
economic security and the products those Blockchain Networks enable. Right now
it is not super clear to me whether being right in the middle along those
distributions is a pro or a con. One argument would be that the middle is the
goldy locks zone, basically where the magic happens. Another argument would be
that the middle is where you are constantly attacked from all sides. I could
even see both being true in their own right, leaving the value attribution for
each argument in itself unclear still. Throughout the year the gap between ETH.D
and SOL.D will close a little bit. And while BTC receives the institutional bid
throughout the year, ETH will receive the speculative and then the institutional
bid as well eventually. The interest for ETH spot ETF products will be moderate.
And while there are no enormous demand expectations additional to what is
intrinsic to the Ethereum Blockchain Network already, the moist bullish
assumption there is right now is the fact that we never saw ETH ripping with all
the now underlying structural changes that happened over the past 2 years.
Namely, Proof of Stake, Fee Burn, Layer 2 blockspace demand and all the ETH
stored and bridged and staked and allocated in all kinds of smart contracts and
wallets. The surprise to the upside might be violent, but it remains to be seen
if ETH can tripple throughout 2024.
