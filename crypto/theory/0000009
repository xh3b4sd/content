The more fundamental substance an asset has, the more value you can expect from
that asset over time. On the other hand, the less fundamental substance an asset
has, the more it relies on temporary narrative and mindshare. Those fragile
assets usually have a very short half life. And the longer you wait to get
involved in those fragile assets the more you become at risk of chasing momentum
that eventually will turn against you.
