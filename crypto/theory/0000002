There has to be an economic cost equilibrium for transactions within Blockchain
Networks. Cheaper blockspace below the cost of the economic cost equilibrium
will always be filled with more spam, eventually degrading the networks utility.
Garbage in, garbage out. That is mainly why there must be any form of spam
protection mechanism, preventing an attacker from overloading a Blockchain
Network.
