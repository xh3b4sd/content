MEMO W51 DEC 2023

Lots of ETH centric people and conversations moved from Twitter to Warpcast over
the past months, leaving a vacuum for non-ETH centric noise.

Lots and lots of cope, fighting and far out human behaviour on the timeline.
Basically a lot of people are a lot of wrong while the rotation trades are
passed around.

The VCs have abandoned Ethereum, Bitcoin Maxis touting the death of Ethereum,
again. Market structure appears to be about to change. ETH selling over. SOL
acumulation over.
