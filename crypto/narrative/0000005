MEMO W01 JAN 2024

The market corrected after somebody said something on Twitter about the Bitcoin
spot ETF. The dump immediately reverted back up to the mean like nothing
happened.

Restaking was talked about a lot in light of what Eigenlayer is building. The
innovation driven here is extremely interesting and could become a great driver
for ETH demand, because ETH's economic security could be used to underpin any
kind of trustless system. The first application we will see this year will be
EigenDA.

Rotating from ETH into SOL right now would be the dumbest fucking thing you
could possibly do. SOL sits at monthly resistance after 10xing last year. ETH is
going to get its own spot ETF this or next year. The ETH pump is long overdue.
The Ansems of the world argue that the bull market will be over if ETH pumps at
last.

Given that the BTC spot ETF approval is priced at 95% during the coming week,
the market should go higher. If BTC is at 44.5k today, then we could see it go
to 48k, which is monthly resistance.
