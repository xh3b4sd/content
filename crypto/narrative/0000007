MEMO W03 JAN 2024

The week started with some shitcoin rallys, while the top 10 dumped or stayed
flatish. The week was chop-bleed overall. In fact the whole market was over
extended. Crypto as well as stocks. After AI and ETF narratives brought us here,
we have to take a breather it seems, wich is totally fine. SPX and NDX printed
new ATHs. BTC failed to print a strong bull flag after its ass fell out.

With nearly $30 billion in assets under management, Bitcoin is now the second
largest asset class after gold in US commodities ETFs.

In Davos, Jamie Dimon showed how he does not understand bitcoin by uttering some
gibberish that didn't make any sense at all. On the upside though, he shilled
tokenisation just like Larry Fink started to do on CNBC.

Expectations for the year are mixed with a bullish bias, because muh election
year. All things considered we stay long and do better by doing less. Towards
the end of the year there is more uncertainty, but we address those issues once
we get there.
