The client diversity debate on Ethereum got louder after we have seen Besu and
Nethermind causing quite a bit of problems in test and production networks.
About 80% of Ethereum mainnet runs on Geth. A single critical bug in Geth could
potentially cause chain split scenarios that would imply the destruction of the
majority of staked ETH across validator pools. Since we are going to face a fair
amount of upgrades with the coming Dencun hard fork I have unstaked all my ETH
just in case. The paranoid shall survive. In April we will see whether client
diversity improved and how the Dencun upgrade worked out.

I saw an interesting chart theory suggesting ETH's cycle top to be between 10k
and 15k around the middle of 2025. It was compelling due to its underlying
technicals but the conclusion was too bullish for me. Adapting the theory I saw
using my own multiples I came out at around 8k, which is roughly half of what
the bulls expect for next year. We had a betalated sell the news event induced
by GBTC exits causing -20% from local top to local bottom. ETH continues to
underperform BTC and SOL and I expect that to continue for most of the year.

A great point was made again about demographics where US boomers tend to hold
money savely available in MMFs while interest rates are elevated. Trillions of
USD are not participating in the stock market right now. When rate cuts hit the
coming months then we may start to see a flush of MMFs at some point, partially
going out on the risk curve and everything will be completely bonkers again.
