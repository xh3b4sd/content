MEMO W52 DEC 2023

Many charts topped out locally. Market is saturated and heated in many places.
Solana season calmed down a bit. Reality seems to set in slowly but surely.

BTC ETF expectations are topping out being only days away from Jan 10th
deadline. Uncertain times ahead!

Vitalik dropped a bunch of inspiring blog posts that made the ETH people
rejoice.

ETH/BTC bottom is in and the rotators might rotate soon. If this moment is still
not the bottom then crypto twitter will lose their shit.
