I got into Habits Of A Happy Brain, written by Loretta Graziano Breuning. This
one describes how to build new neural pathways within 45 days and how the brain
is influenced by endorphin, oxytocin, serotonin, dopamine and cortisol.
Basically, when you get more rewards you trigger dopamine production. When you
are physically secure, endorphin is released. When you feel the social support
around you, oxytocin production ramps up. And we seek out to gain respect
because serotonin makes us feel superior. Cortisol means to prevent pain and
causes stress reactions so we act and get out of dangerous situations. The book
is pretty academical but relates to the every day life of all of us. The author
describes how one may rewire their brain using micro routines. For that to work
one needs to consistently implement a strategic behaviour so that you train
yourself vigorously. There are a lot of interesting facts presented. One that I
found super crazy was that there are 10 times more neurons reaching from the
cortex to the eyes than from the eyes back to the cortex. The implication of
this is that the images we perceive are often interpreted as rather unimportant
compared to the predictions our strong neural pathways create in a given
situation. So what is out there and what we make out of it are pretty much two
totally different stories. The last chapter provides a lot of interesting book
suggestions for further reading, like Carl Sagan's The Dragons Of Eden. I will
certainly check that one out.
