I got into Good Strategy Bad Strategy, written by Richard Rumelt. I found this
one via a YouTube video I shared in #podcasts. It flashed me a little bit and
thought the book could be something. I did not get disappointed. I enjoyed the
audiobook pretty much. It is quite lengthy but it made me think a lot and caused
some really cool brainstorming inside of me. The Author itself was an Engineer
in his early days at the JPL. Throughout his career he worked as consultant for
all kinds of businesses. The book tells stories about industry titans. How some
of them rose and how some of them fell. I was a bit sad when the book came to a
sudden end. Over the past few days I told a couple of people already a story
that I got from the book and that really sticks with me. Looking at any system,
its nature is to increase in complexity. What people aim for in order to succeed
within a system, is to reduce complexity. I found this abstract point of view
extremely appealing and useful. Another interesting thought was that successful
strategies implement relative strengths to work against relative weaknesses.
This played out conflict then results in a fundamental upside which works
towards your advantage. I will get into this book again at some point. When you
want to understand what a strategy is in itself and how you can design it rather
well than not, this book is for you.
