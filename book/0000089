I got into Zero To One, written by Peter Thiel. This is the kind of business
books I love. The style is like the Ben Horowitz books, full of insights and
unconventional CEO wisdom. Thiel tries to explain the narrative of not following
known industrial paths but instead making up new ones. There are lots of really
compelling ideas and for me the information provided are super valuable. Thiel
shares his thoughts about culture and sales as well as indicators that predict
the likelihood of a business to either succeed or fail. In that light, Thiel
believes that you cannot have something like culture in the first place.
Instead, he claims that you are that very culture yourself. Interestingly he
claims that failing sales are the number one reason for businesses to vanish.
That is kind of obvious but the implications are huge. It does not matter how
good your product or service is if you cannot convince anyone to pay for it. A
failing company culture is then proclaimed to be reason number two of failing
businesses. Thiel suggests that sales works best in case it is hidden and nobody
even thinks you really want to sell anything. And then there was one thing that
I found extremely compelling. So when you do not see any sales person around,
you are the sales person. More interesting thoughts evolve around the ratio of
customer lifetime value and customer acquisition cost aka CLV/CAC. With this
book I found a new favourite, cheers.
