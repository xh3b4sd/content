I got into Blue Ocean Strategy, written by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne.
Narrative of the book is that there are red and blue oceans in the markets. A
red ocean is where everybody competes and no real innovation takes place. A blue
ocean is where value innovation creates new demand for something nobody can
really compete against. The market is ever evolving though and so do business
models as well as competitors. Blue oceans turn inevitably red over time. The
book provides strategies and lots of cool concepts to implement. It was a bit
unfortunate that the audio of the audiobook is slightly fucked up and the
chapters are a bit off. Anyway, I think Giant Swarm created a blue ocean with
exceptional first level support which transforms a highly functional sector into
a partially emotional one. Or at least, one where emotional bonds play a
stronger role. The question in the long run will be how Giant Swarm can maintain
the leading position of value innovation to be always ahead of the curve,
because competitors will pick up. Providing the best support ever will not be
too sustainable as a strategy. Managed apps are a good way to extend to other
blue oceans. What comes after that do only know the stars. We will find out. I
enjoyed Blue Ocean Strategy a lot and it made me think a lot about Giant Swarm,
its current position and its future. The book is somehow related to the somewhat
series of From Good to Great suggested above.
