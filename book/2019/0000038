I got into Why Do I Do That, written by Joseph Burgo. The book is about
psychological defence mechanisms we all implement more or less. It made me think
and shed some light on certain aspects of my own thought process. The book
replicates a lot of what I think in certain situations and exposes common flaws
and fallacies. One aspect that made me think in particular was the premise that
everyone's life is constantly in pain. So everyone tries to cope with whatever
they suffer from and synchronizing two people on that level may range from
somehow doable to impossible. The author has more books on the psychological
topics. The book here was pretty cool and not too long. I need to listen to it
again at some point.
