I got into From Good to Great, written by Jim Collins. Pretty interesting on a
conceptual basis, but a bit lengthy as well. The first version got published
about two decades ago or something, and the view on the technology sector is a
bit behind. There was a lot of academical research put into the book and a lot
of different people worked on that project. There was not too much new stuff in
there for me personally, as certain key aspects of successful teams and
companies seem to repeat in all the pieces out there. Collins defined the idea
of level 5 leadership, where the fifth level is an extension of certain soft
skills human have to implement to reach that level. He argues that this is
actually what society holds together in parts. Another nice summary I came up
with during the book goes along these lines. Give people responsibility within a
framework based company culture and manage the system's rules, instead of the
people.
