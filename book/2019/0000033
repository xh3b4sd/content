I got into The Effective Executive, written by Peter Drucker. The Audiobook
version I listened to was the 50th anniversary version of the book. It got
initially published in 1966. Some minor notes are outdated but the major
sentiment holds true until today. Every person is the executive of their life.
The book is about time management and journaling to understand habits and
whatnot. Not so much new for me. It got recommended by Tim Ferris and Jim
Collins who narrates the foreword of the special edition here. One sentiment I
liked a lot was about meeting preparation. When you do not prepare meetings, you
steal the attendees lifetime. Another one is that conflict of opinion is a tool,
not a problem. And then, the effective executive focuses on contributions to the
team, and not so much on status, politics or other resources. Focusing on
contributions is where we shine and make everyone involved better off.
