I got into Light Of The Stars, written by Adam Frank. That piece is scientific
and philosophical, trying to answer where everybody is in the universe. The
Fermi Paradox. The great filter. And the better question may be, when was
everybody? When we look at the stars and try to reason about the number of
scientific civilisations next to ours we try to calculate a probability based on
Drake's equation. With Kepler we found so many exoplanets and stars being
orbited by planets turned out to be the rule, not the exception. Calculating how
much civilisations may be out there and how long they exist on average gives us
pretty interesting insights in our own fate. The thought experiments and
physical insights outlined in the book are pretty cool. For instance, knowing
how weather works on Earth, and observing how weather works on Mars and Venus,
brings us to the conclusion that weather behaves everywhere the same, no matter
how many light years away. Fascinating read. Much wow. Mostly listened to it
throughout the flights last week.
