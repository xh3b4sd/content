I got into Blink, written by Malcolm Gladwell. His books are usually quite nice
and this one is too as I figured out. Each chapter is about a story taken out of
real life. They all have one thing in common. An assumedly minor detail,
happening within a fraction of a second, has huge consequences in certain
situations. Little cues in our behaviour expose our most inner workings. So it
came that Gottman, a psychological researcher, studies divorce predictions. He
can tell who will stay together with 90% accuracy, only by looking at a video of
a couple's conversation capturing 15 minutes of their interactions. Another
interesting concept sticking to me is the occasion of momentary autism. It
happens when our environment starts to flood us with too many information while
we have too little time to make sense of it. The result of momentary autism is
then, more often than not, catastrophe. Taking it into account for ones own
life, a single moment can make all the difference. Call it intuition, within the
blink of an eye, you can feel what is right or wrong, as well as failing to do
so dramatically. The audiobook was only 5 hours and definitely worth it.
