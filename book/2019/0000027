I got into The Spider Network, written by David Enrich. The story hooked me up
the more and more I got into it. It describes the rise and fall of Tom Hayes.
IMO his fall was pretty much orchestrated, which is the actual scam of the whole
story as I see it. Hayes became a trader and exploited LIBOR rates in favour of
his derivative positions. It was a more or less accepted and widely implemented
game within the banking industry. With the financial crisis around 2008
investigations started. The backstabbing started. I do not want to spoil too
much here but I got outraged at the end of the book. Super interesting story.
Fascinating topic. The book is quite lengthy though and one needs to go through
15 hours in the audiobook.
