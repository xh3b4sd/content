I got into Lord of the Flies, written by William Golding. Golding narrates
himself. I had quite some struggle to follow the plot due to the common language
and accent. The story is fictional. A group of childish boys stranding on an
island. The moral tries to depict how essential rules are to civilisation and
how dark humans tend to be. I liked the closing words a lot, where Golding says
that the interpretation is up to you and not what somebody else thinks. This
describes the concept of interpretation as what it should actually be seen for,
subjective. Back in school I found it always weird that some teacher judged my
interpretation of a story and gave me a D for it or something like that.
