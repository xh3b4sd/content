I got into Sapiens, written by Yuval Noah Harari. The first third was really
cool. Lots about how humans evolved starting around 70.000 years ago. How we
spread across the planet even into the farthest of places. Wherever we appeared,
most of big mammals and predators vanished forever. There have still ben
saver-toothed tigers in America around 10.000 years ago. That was around the
time humans arrived. A couple of centuries later, done. The most interesting
phenomenon happened to the human evolution was the occurrence os us being able
to tell stories. We tell all kinds of stories: families, money, governments, you
name it. The second third of the book was boring to me because it was all about
religion and its rooted association in most of our cultures. Basically, just
another story. The third third of the book is more about the industrial
revolution, modern times and the potential of the future. Bio-tech, AI, and so
on. Fun fact, which I find really really interesting, there are as twice as much
people killing theirselves than people being killed by others. Like, wow. Think
about that when talking about world peace. There is more war within ourselves
than between countries or whomever. The book is a bit long, but I liked it.
