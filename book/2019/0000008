I got into As A Man Thinketh, written by James Allen. The audiobook has a bad
quality. The performance made the content somehow not really connect with me.
These cases are always unfortunate and I feel like such occasions are somewhat
my fault because I let the messenger influence my understanding of the message.
I found the book is too dry though. Allen apparently narrated the book, which is
weird, because he died back in 1912. That would somehow explain the bad quality
but I wonder where it came from. The audiobook was just an hour. I got the
recommendation from some Tim Ferris book list so I thought "let's try". I got
one thing from the book though, and this was about the idea of serenity. Its
importance and effect on the mind are interesting. I would describe the state of
serenity to be somewhat emotionally disconnected from the world. Observing,
floating above it all. Assuming the state of serenity is like shielding you from
all the pain of life and makes you more compassionate for the suffering everyone
is experiencing all the time. Life is hard, and if it is not you are doing it
wrong. Trying to observe events from a little distance can certainly help making
sense out of the overly emotional mess we are usually captivated in. So you can
keep your cool.
