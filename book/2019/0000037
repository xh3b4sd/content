I got into The Art Of Strategy, written by Barry J. Nalebuff. A pretty long book
about game theoretical aspects of life. A lot of examples of politics, military
and industry. What clicked with me were several chapters around auctions and
voting/incentive systems. In economics there is something like a dominant
strategy that "players" should aspire to. In certain games and settings you have
something like an equilibrium as described by John Nash who received the Nobel
Price in Economic Sciences. You may know his story from A Beautiful Mind. The
book contains a lot of further book recommendations around the various topics. A
bit lengthy, but I liked it.
