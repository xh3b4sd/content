I got into The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck, written by Mark Manson. Some
wishy washy self help guide ranging from bullshit to cool. I personally found a
lot of views shared being way to US American. And that is where a lot of
bullshit actually comes from when you have the slightest feeling of looking
beyond the fence. What I got from it though is that your own value system
counts. It determines what success and happiness looks like for you. What it
means to you and how you may achieve it, or not. The book tells a story that
success and happiness comes and only can be sorted from insight yourself. You
decide what is important to you and what actually has value. For you it might be
Netflixing. For me it might be getting shit done. You got to pick your battles
and everything, at the end, is only about your own legacy. Don’t let culture or
Twitter decide how life has to look like. That what is left when you are gone
counts. And once you are gone your shitty Instagram account might not be too
important anymore for anyone. The audiobook is only five hours and ok to tune in
meanwhile, but it did not blow me away to be honest.
