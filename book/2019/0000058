I got into Flow, written by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. The concept of flow is
really interesting and powerful. I got aware of it a couple of years ago when I
learned to juggle. Flow happens when you get lost in some activity. Side effects
are to lose sense of time, a feeling of fulfilment and enhancement of skills.
Flow can be achieved by doing almost any physical or mental activity. The
Audiobook describes the science behind the psychological processes going on
inside of us. There are certain cognitive prerequisites people have to have in
order to be able to get into a state of flow. One of these requirements is to be
able to deeply focus. I can experience flow when I run on my own through the
dark rainy forrest, hacking on some software project while moving through my
mental map of the project architecture, or fighting on the mats trying to
exploit my opponent. The book Flow provides several really interesting aspects
from a psychological point of view. There is this idea about complex
personalities. Complex personalities do not seem to be too common in the real
world. A complex personality is defined by 5 major characteristics: clarity,
centring, choice, commitment and challenge. The Audiobook version is like a set
of tapes the author recorded during some interview and then they made a book out
of it or something. But anyway, the content is pretty cool, so give it a try.
