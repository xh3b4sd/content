I got into The Power Of Habit, written by Charles Duhigg. So, about 60% of brain
activity is habitual. Habit loops are part of the brain's strategies to enhance
performance. You do something until you do it kind of automatically, without
thinking. The habit loop as we understand it starts with a cue, followed by a
routine and a reward, which causes a craving and closes the cycle. Between a
little bit of science this book offers pretty cool stories and explains based on
cool examples how our brain is chunking information. There are even legal
implications where lawyers argue that you are not liable for automatically
executed habits you did not consciously control. A man killed his wife during
sleep terror and was found not guilty in court. Super controversial. One chapter
is full of data mining and predictive analytics. Like, the holy grail in the
market is to bind pregnant women to your brand so they spend all their money at
you. Pretty interesting. I like the book a lot.
