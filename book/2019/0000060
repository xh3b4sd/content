I got into Death By Meeting, written by Patrick Lencioni. This book wasn't even
that good. Considering that Lencioni wrote about ten other books with similarly
intriguing titles, I am somehow not willing to pay him more after my experience
with this one. The book here tells a rather boring story about some Startup in
the gaming industry. The only point the book tries to make is how important
meetings are and that most people are guilty themselves of making meetings not
worthwhile. The author talks about meetings called "daily check-in" like he
invented the idea of the stand-up. To sum it up, meetings are bad when they lack
structure or constructive conflict. I liked this conclusion in the end but it
doesn't take five hours to transport this idea. One interesting aspect I figured
in the end is that facilitators of meetings have to proactively mine for hidden
conflict so that attendees can address it. I certainly have to think more about
that idea. Regardless, no recommendation for this one.
