I got into The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, written by John Bogle.
Here we got some solid investment advices which got proven over the past
decades. Therefore there is actually nothing new in that sense. Rule of thumb is
that you cannot beat the market, thus you need to own it. Low cost traditional
index funds is what appears to be the very best way how Average Joe can invest
their money. Another interesting aspect is the concept of reversion to the mean.
Portfolio rockstars tend to decline back into mediocracy over time. So what
appears to be a sure thing will almost certainly backfire. The book gets
repetitive pretty quickly and stopped to be interesting for me after the first
couple of chapters. Nonetheless it was cool to get confirmation of certain best
practices in the financial market.
