I got into Utopia For Realists, written by Rutger Bregman. The first chapters
made me think. The book has a touch of Factfulness, which I liked a lot. Premise
here in the first place is that we do not have new ideas for the future as such.
When we think and talk about the future, we repeat ideas and thoughts of
somebody else. There is rarely a discussion about something totally new. Later
the book became economical and political. It became more uninteresting by the
chapter.
