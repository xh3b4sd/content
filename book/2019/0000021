I got into Why We Sleep, written by Matthew Walker. I love this book. There is
so much to take away from at least for myself. The bottom line is, that almost
everything is better with sufficient sleep. Sleep deprivation is the most
underestimated, most epidemic and most expensive illness of our time. Humans are
the only living organism volunteering for regular sleep deficits. Your sleep
cycle is, as in, what your body wants, commanded by your circadian rhythm, which
is weirdly not exactly 24 hours long, but around 15 minutes longer on average. I
personally have the feeling I am going towards 25 hours in total. It is also
that toddlers, children, teenagers and adults have all different preferences.
That is especially interesting for parents. I figured I have a little onset
insomnia, which is the problem of falling asleep. Based on studies when you only
sleep 5 hours, you have a three fold increase in the likelihood of having a car
accident. Ken Parks, amongst other rare cases, murdered during somnambulism. FFI
is a sleep disorder that kills within 10 months. Chernobyl happened when sleep
deprived operators were at play. There are strong correlations between sleep
deficits and all kinds of negative health implications, Alzheimer's Disease and
Cardiovascular Disease are the most common. The flu costs the US around 100
billion US Dollars every year because of workers impacting the economy for not
going to work. Compared to that, sleep deprivation is estimated to go into the
trillions due to slacking, insufficiencies, decreased creativity and accidents.
There is so much more. Check it out.
