I got into Apex, written by Ramez Naam. This is the third part of the Nexus
Trilogy, finishing up about 45 hours of an interesting Audiobook experience.
Apex got too complex for my taste and was in parts rather work than
entertainment or inspiration for me personally. There was quite a complexity
explosion of story lines. I think it was at times a dozen of different
situations happening at the same time. Describing them in apparently random
order was really difficult to follow. I couldn't keep up with all the characters
involved. I got problems understanding the roles of all the various characters
and how they fit into the picture. In fact I had often the feeling certain story
lines did not add much to the saga itself. I stopped being impressed or
surprised about certain developments in the story lines approaching the end of
the book. I was neither excited, happy nor particularly sad with the outcome
now. There are some interesting ideas I take away from it about possible future
developments of our species though. Being more and more interconnected and
enhanced. The human dynamics on our planet are vastly confusing and often even
opposing which I will continue to ponder on. Nice little SciFi overall, stopping
to get deep once you touched the essence of it in the first and second book.
