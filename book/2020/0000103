I got into The Ride Of A Lifetime, written by Robert Iger. This is the guy who
expanded Disney like crazy due to all kinds of huge acquisitions. The book got
suggested left and right so I became intrigued. Iger and his trajectory is
really impressive. I liked listening to his history with Steve Jobs. How well
they knew each other. The stories around Disney's acquisition of Pixar was super
interesting because that also shed some light on several reasons why Pixar has
been such a success itself. Iger attributes all the success you can have in the
world to several core values and principles which are summarized again at the
end of the book. One core value I like in particular, and this is unshakable
integrity. Iger says innovate or die. He says to never forget the child you once
have been. So, dare to dream.
