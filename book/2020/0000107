I got into Genome, written by Matt Ridley. The book is structured in 23 chapters
of which each of them evolves around one of the chromosome pairs humans obtain
within their DNA. Ridley is actually a journalist and produced a quite
scientific book with this one here. There are uncountable interesting topics
covered in Genome where most of them were far beyond my educational horizon.
Though one thing I was particularly curious about is how biological life works
as a system. Ridley compares the biological machine quite a couple of times with
the digital machine we call computer. Compelling enough this argument is not too
far fetched considering we just started to figure out how anything inside of us
actually works. Like ignorant logic gates in computer chips, DNA can code for
proteins and while each protein is just minding its own business the amount of
complexity involved makes up for a circulatory system that tries to sustain
itself by computation and replication. In the midst of all this complexity
something like genetic debt accumulates. There are different estimations and we
continue to learn more about the intricacies of our genetic code, though it
might be that about two thirds of our DNA is kind of legacy and does not code
for anything useful anymore. We just appear to carry around a lot of junk DNA.
There are more super interesting ideas which I was not fully able wrap my head
around. One of them showed somehow that parasites play an omnipresent part in
almost any system, because the mere function of certain computational units
within our bodies is to sustain themselves due to self replication. Which is
then also where all the junk DNA comes from. Nobody uses it. Nobody does
anything about it. All super crazy and super deep biology right here.
