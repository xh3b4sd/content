I got into Brief, written by Joseph McCormack. I found this one via some
military book recommendations. It is simply put about saying more by saying
less. Not just by using fewer words but rather by being aware of using more
appropriate words and structures which are most relevant to a given context. The
author is a consultant advising decision makers across various industries. The
examples within the book come right out of the corners of business, military and
policy making. The essence I take away from here is that you have to draw a
mental picture within the heads of people so that they can understand the
message you want to get out. Diagrams, videos and any visual assistance works so
well because we are visual beings who consume the majority of information around
us with our eyes. Written language is already an abstracted stream of data that
adds another layer of complexity on top of the art of communication. You can
easily overexplain something like dancing around a fire. We often think that we
clearly articulate what is most relevant but yet so often we miss our actual
target. In a conversation for instance it is most useful when you talk with
somebody, instead of talking at somebody. That is a subtle difference
potentially having vast consequences. The book is on point and contains a lot of
super useful narratives. Go get some.
