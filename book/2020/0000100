I got into An Elegant Puzzle, written by Will Larson. In my opinion, nothing is
elegant about this piece. The content is actually not more than a list of "best
practices" written in the charm of a corporate rulebook. When someone is up for
a dry mind map evolving around hiring funnels and enterprise management I would
really recommend. There are a couple of ideas of systems thinking as the author
himself has an engineering background. Though the suggestions made here come
mostly out of an environment of multiple hundreds of employees. I couldn't find
much in here all things considered.
