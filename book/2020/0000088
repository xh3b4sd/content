I got into A Closed And Common Orbit, written by Becky Chambers. It is the
second book in the Wayfarers series. Two different story lines merge together
towards the end of the book. In the typical Becky Chambers style the worlds and
characters are so warm and vivid. I sometimes felt like certain situations could
have been described in more depth and detail just to make it last a little
longer. There is often a slight tendency of universal cultural bias swinging
with the chapters, as if worldly behaviour is a fact of life. And stars, do I
love the complexity of moral dilemmas the characters go through. Especially the
aspects of AI "ghost in a shell" kind of identity crisis one of the
protagonists has to deal with.
