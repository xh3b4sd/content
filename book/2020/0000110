I got into Creative Selection, written by Ken Kocienda. Here you get a little
bit of the "behind the curtain" insights of the Apple design process. Kocienda
was part of the initial webkit development. There are quite a couple of
interesting take aways. They wanted to build the fastest web browser. So one
strategy of theirs in order to get there was to not apply any changes to the
code base which slow down the overall performance. The pageload test was hooked
up with their continuous integration processes. Over time there was a natural
development towards faster performance only due to this very simple integrated
guideline. Further, together with his teams, Kocienda worked on the first iPhone
and iPad prototypes and he helped leading these products to their official
releases. They designed and implemented the first digital keyboards on touch
screens, ever. The insights evolve a little bit around the pathology of a
software engineer. All kinds of best practices are elaborated. Though one thing
where it boils down to and what may not be as easy to copy is a certain sense of
taste. It appears that a lot of Apple's internal design process evolves around
simplicity, practicality and a gut feeling. One thing that sticks to me is this.
Design is how it works.
