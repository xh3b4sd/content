I got into The Future Of The Mind, written by Michio Kaku. This book should
actually be called "The Past, Presence And Future Of The Mind". There is
actually not too much future in there. The book does also not provide too much
of new information in case one has even the least interest in science in
general. So the book is somewhat interesting but did not really give me a lot.
Some of the noteworthy topics being discussed are brain machine interfaces and
from there all kinds of cool shit can be done. We could get real exoskeletons or
emerge into some form of collective intelligence. Merging more and more with
technology is kind of inevitable as mankind did always pursue this ideal. So
this trend will continue and the bottom line is pretty much that the brain
itself is a machine. We do not understand it yet, and it remains to be seen if
we will ever be able to comprehend something like our own consciousness.
