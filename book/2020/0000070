I got into Ignorance, written by Stuart Firestein. Here we got a book suggesting
how to approach the process of scientific work. There is the known and the
unknown. Knowing something is like reaching a destination. Sometimes it means to
reach a dead end. In science you deal with a lot of noise and you have to find
the signal. Ignoring the "right" noise, blending out the "right" data, could be
one method of finding the signal you are looking for. This is very much about
focus and the understanding of knowing what to focus on and what not. You need
to develop a systematic understanding of a certain domain in order to apply that
very method. A nice example is the technology sector. Another one might be
languages. Assuming you are reading some article or book you don't fully
understand in terms of domain or language, you need to be able to skip over the
black holes and blind spots in order to try to make sense of a part of the
content. That way you can draw conclusions and start to understand fundamental
concepts of the domain or language, simply by connecting the dots. This cannot
be achieved by plain memorization. The book was interesting. Sparked a bit of
curiosity. Not super exciting, but I guess you have to like it that way.
