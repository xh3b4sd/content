I got into To Be Taught If Fortunate, written by Becky Chambers. Super cute.
Deeply emotional. Rich language. The short fictional story told here describes
the journey of a space exploration mission. 4 trained astronauts and scientists
seek out to do research on far away exoplanets. The technology of the time is
pretty advanced but not too strange. At first I was a bit annoyed by all the
buzz within the first chapters, wondering what it contributes to the story. Then
it kind of clicked with me. Becomes extremely philosophically and made me think.
Questions are raised. Like, where is home? Where to go? Considering the
disconnection between you and the rest of mankind while traveling through space
and time, one wonders about the importance of certain earthly affairs. Like the
complacency of the pale blue dot somewhere out there in the middle of the milky
way.
