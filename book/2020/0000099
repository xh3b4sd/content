I got into Record Of A Spaceborn Few, written by Becky Chambers. This is the
third episode of The Wayferers Trilogy. The described universe is as vivid as
ever, but for me personally the storylines became too complex and thus the book
as such less coherent. For some reason I couldn't connect to the protagonists
over the whole distance. Once in a while there was a spark and I really felt the
story but more often than not I kind of lost it along the way. My expectations
have been pretty high by all people around hyping the third part so much but I
cannot join the fanboy bandwagon here really. I liked the narrative of life and
death out there in the dark and how the circle of life rules all species more or
less equally. What I would really love to see is the cinematic reincarnation at
some point. After all this here is real hype shit material. Glad I made it this
far, but coming from the first episode, I would say the second was my personal
favorite.
