I got into From Impossible To Inevitable, written by Jason Lemkin. A book
centred around the venture ecosystem. Lemkin shares his experiences on different
aspects of founding and running a company. Two thirds of the book have an
enterprisy touch. Hard to the facts. In the end Lemkin shares more personal
anecdotes about his own life and schedule as a father of ten children. A couple
of insights were quite revealing. Like certain characteristics of "Mr
Dashboard", a Vice President or Chief of anything trying to tune a machine
purely by the numbers. There was no judgement on characteristics like these.
Just the plain understanding of how certain jobs may have to be done in any
given context. Knowing things like these can for sure be beneficial when getting
around the venture ecosystem. Same applies to the idea of builders versus
growers. One can pull something off, out of thin air. The other can make it
scale. Both characteristics are not always present in one and the same person.
So you got to understand which one you are and what you might not be able to do.
Another thing I liked was highlighting the responsibility that each and every
individual has for themselves. Nobody will come, knock on your door, and do the
work you are supposed to do. Nobody will come and fix your life, marriage or
organization. You got to do it.
