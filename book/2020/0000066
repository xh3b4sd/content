I got into Writing My Wrongs, written by Shaka Senghor. A few years ago I saw a
Ted Talk from him already. Now I found he wrote a couple of books, of which
Writing My Wrongs was mentioned by Ben Horowitz IIRC. Senghor's story caught my
interest. It roughly goes like this. Being a drug dealer and getting shot with
17, Sengor killed a man and got convicted of murder with 19. During almost two
decades of imprisonment he went through a personal transformation. Eventually,
Senghor got released from confinement and ever tried to support his community.
His role in the world of prisons is a bit blurry. AFAIK he was at least an
inspirational figure to a lot of prisoners. There are a couple of interesting
lessons to take away from the book. There are no natural rights. Freedom cannot
be taken for granted. People can change if they want to. Every human can kill,
if they have to. The life in a prison is absurd and you might just get stabbed
in the shower over a pudding. Freedom has to be earned as it seems. Just as life
has to.
