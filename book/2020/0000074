I got into Social Intelligence, written by Daniel Goleman. Really rich book full
of fascinating studies around the social sciences. The book explains how
contagious emotions are and how strong our effect on people around us really can
be. As such, the quality of our relationships does influence our immune system.
In that sense people can really make you sick. Moreover, parents can make their
children sick, and of course the other way around as well. There are many
highlights on how fragile humans are during their developmental phases in life
and how easily child-care can go wrong in one way or the other. I found
interesting how manageable distress during ones early years can cause curiosity
and competence later in life. Important is only to prevent people from being too
secure and getting traumatized, as these two would be the extreme ends of the
experience distribution. In case everything around them makes them sick people
can apparently develop something like a social allergy where neural pathways
foster a spiral of negative associations. Another super interesting thought was
the need for a compassionate capitalism and I really need to think about this
more. The book Social Intelligence is quite big and contains a crazy amount of
information around the topic. Extremely interesting and certainly good for one
or two revelations.
