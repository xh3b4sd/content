I got into Accelerate, written by Nicole Forsgren. This book is about software
delivery best practices. The authors also work on The State Of DevOps Reports
which evolve around the principles of Westrum's theorem of organizational
structure. The reports they make try to find correlations between high
performing teams, company culture and especially mental health issues like
burnout. That might be interesting to think about but I would not say this book
here is a particularly good place to start with. While there have been a couple
of interesting numbers in the book, it turned into a guide of how to create a
survey based on psychometrics. It was super dry and not really enjoyable.
Interestingly there was nothing new to me in terms of best practises. Like yeah,
you need CI and release often. One key aspect struck me though. Success in a
team is about certain dynamics and I found this super interesting to ponder on.
So what a successful company should do is to invest into the right primitives so
that a system can be designed as such that it enables and promotes reliable
agility for the people operating within it.
