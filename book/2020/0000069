I got into Drive, written by Daniel Pink. This here is about ideas of intrinsic
motivation. The book required quite an amount of my attention, intellectual and
imaginary capacity. Intrinsic motivation in turn requires a couple of
ingredients, of which individuals value different allocations of them. Overall,
autonomy seems to be one important factor. Creativity may be another one. The
list goes on. Social systems can be designed in order to promote something like
drive inside its participants. Often systems mean to motivate, but effectively
stifle it. Studies suggest the promise of a price you can win for doing
something especially well is often back firing and only doing more harm than
good. People often seem to value intangible goods more than what you can buy
with the holy Dollar. The book has a lot more about mastery, flow and purpose.
It is not really entertaining, but rather meant to address the curious. I liked
some of the book recommendations at the end.
