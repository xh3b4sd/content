I got into The Dragons Of Eden, written by Carl Sagan. Sagan was a science
advocate and wrote a couple of interesting books including Cosmos which got made
popular with a TV Documentary Series. It also got a remake recently presented by
Neil deGrasse Tyson. The Dragons Of Eden is about the evolution of human
intelligence. There are a lot of speculations discussed. There are a lot of
scientific discoveries discussed. But so far we are still trying to comprehend
how we may ended up becoming the sentient beings we are. On the timeline of our
evolution there had to be so many breakthroughs made in a certain sequence in
order to exactly end up right here where we are. Almost like a blueprint of
mankind's evolution that had to happen exactly as it did in order to come to
such a conclusion like human beings. There was one comparison that I found
particularly impressive. The viking space probes we sent to Mars at the end of
the 1970s had as many digital instructions as an ordinary bacterium has encoded
in its DNA. Pondering about the difference in material, distance traveled and
information encoded for different purposes forces my mind into some kind of
peaceful stillness. The book further discusses a little bit about the Fermi
Paradox which I find extremely interesting in general. And one last example.
There was an argument made in the book for the amount of polymaths developing in
a society that allows and supports children to freely and non judgementally
explore their own wild tendencies and curiosities. A lot of food for thought
right here.
