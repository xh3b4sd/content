I got into Secrets Of Sandhill Road, written by Scott Kupor. Straight out of the
world of venture capital, Kupor is managing partner at a16z. The book is a
crazily detailed walk through of several imaginary Startup stories and explains
why VC is a thing in the first place. Some optimal and some worst case scenarios
give hints on what to potentially expect when taking money from a VC. That made
me think about some of the implications when getting financed by someone who is
looking for a 10x return and that at best tomorrow. After all though, you can
only lose the money you invest. Over the past 20 years companies stay private
for way longer. In the 2000s startups got public within an average of 4 years.
Nowadays IPOs are rather only seen something like 10 years after inception. So
in a lot of cases it might just be better to get money from somewhere else,
since money does not appear to be the most sparse resource anymore. What matters
more in a majority of cases is the network access which you buy in return for
your equity. When you want to know more about the board of directors within
startups or constructs of employee option pools, this one here is for you. But
careful, complicated. VC is an art, not a science.
