I got into Keeping At It, written by Paul Volcker. This here is more like
Volcker's memoir. The book is broken up into smaller stories. These are not
chronologically ordered. I found that rather confusing because I could not
really comprehend which experiences shaped him and which decisions had a
particular impact on his life. And then the book is overall a bit dry. Full of
monetary policy making. For him it was apparently always important that there is
trust in government and that governments are able to do the right thing. Volcker
himself served as chairman and board member in all kinds of high profile
organizations. One of them was the Federal Reserve. He explains that roles with
oversight and coordination require you to have a solid moral compass in order to
provide the appropriate ethical guidance. Hard skills are not so important in
certain domains, but he argues that you cannot do without the right soft skills
when having great responsibility. Volcker is an impressive man as it seems. A
life well lived. Though the book is rather a reddish than a strawberry.
