I got into Energy: Bolinda Beginner Guide, written by Vaclav Smil. This book is
a very rational roundhouse kick about roughly everything energy related. Smil
explains in a somewhat dry manner what energy is from a physics point of view
and walks the spectator through the history of things. It starts out with a
rough picture of the universe, but quickly dives into all of our earthly
affairs. Here one can learn a lot about energy density, mechanisms, measurements
and units of energy. And now you also know that 1 Joule is the equivalent of 1
Newton Meter. Further the book explains a lot about the planet's atmosphere,
food chains, biological metabolism and our all economic history. Towards the end
it is all about fossil fuels and the transformation of our economies towards
renewable energy. Pretty informative. Pretty dry.
