I got into Economics In One Lesson, written by Henry Hazlitt. A rather dry crash
course on economic principles. The book is surprisingly relevant and applicable
to current times. We see the health of the global economy decline and suffer
from long lasting effects of continuously made bad decisions on the regulatory
level. We are overdue to wipe out the current rulebook and refactor the current
system so that it could be more effective and suitable to modern times. The book
describes tax money allocations for better or worse and how much capital is lost
due to friction. Friction in governance can be a bug and or feature. It is
certainly beneficial for any system to withstand supply shocks of any kind and
sustain through times of uncertainty. Though stability and friction can also
cause innovation to stifle until productivity comes to a halt. We should let the
market decide more often in order to benefit from its equilibrium. These days
such an equilibrium is subsidized away at great cost for society. One must
decide if this is beneficial or harmful for the generations to come. Evolution
is inevitable. Today this is more true than ever. And so we would do better to
embrace on all levels instead of always being decades behind the wave. Change is
coming inevitably, and the more we fight it the harder it will take over in the
end. Industries must adjust or perish over time. The book is a classic and can
make you think a little bit about macro economic dynamics.
