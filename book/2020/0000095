I got into Meltdown, written by Chris Clearfield. This book provides
interdisciplinary insights of failure domains and their fail safes. Most
failures in systems can be explained due to tight coupling in complex systems.
The examples provided come out of real life's industries like aviation, energy,
supply chains and all things digital. For instance, the story of the Volkswagen
Scam is in here. Also the Fokushima Tsunami and the Flint Water Crisis. Further
the book explores family psychology a little bit where a couple of parenting
issues are inspected. One idea I like is the premortem which aims to anticipate
death before it happens. One pitfall I like is the continuation bias which
causes you to proceed despite certain catastrophe. A tool I like is the family
retro in which family members talk about what went well and what didn't
throughout the week. There was a lot to take from that book in my case and I
enjoyed getting to know about the real life stories presented in here. So that
one was definitely worth my time, also because it is quite to the point.
