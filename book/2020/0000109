I got into Thinking In Systems, written by Donella Meadows. The topic of this
book is super fascinating to me. As I see it, systems thinking is in line with a
first principles approach of understanding anything and solving any problem. You
try to to conceptualize a problem domain in order to understand its intrinsic
nature. You can break down pretty much anything into its core elements in order
to describe it as a system. The elements of the system, their connection and
their respective behaviour account for the system as a unit. It gets interesting
once multiple systems interact with one another and create a feedback loop as
such that the interaction between various systems make up for a whole new system
on its own. Any social group can be described as a system. Different social
groups interacting with each other can be described as a system. For instance
two teams working on their respective projects while interacting with one
another can be described as three different systems. That is, one system for
each team of the two, and one system for their interaction with each other.
Studies suggest that the vast majority of problems within systems can be
attributed to incomplete information or the lack of information flow. That
suggests that almost any social system can be fixed or improved by better
communication. The book might be a bit dry, but oddly enough, I just love this
topic. For me there is a lot more to ponder on. Recommend.
