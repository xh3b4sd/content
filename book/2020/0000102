I got into This Is Marketing, written by Seth Godin. He narrates his own books
which I like a lot when authors do that. The basic claim of the book is that
everything boils down to serving people and making them feel the benefits of
your service. It is like consumers do not want what you build. People want what
your service can do for them. People ask "What is in it for me?". There are
three pillars on which his philosophies stand on. These are empathy, connection
and change. In order to connect to people you need to gain the understanding of
their perspective. Once a connection is established you are able to explain the
idea of a favourable transitions which you can realize with whatever you try to
"sell". You then try to normalize new behaviour. The book has a lot of
interesting concepts to offer like pattern match versus pattern interrupt. This
means as much as you try to make people stick to their habits or replace them
with new ones. The book kept my mind spinning which I like a lot once in a
while. I keep brainstorming while listening to the audiobook and get into some
kind of flow state. It is a bit like dancing with the ideas of the book. Back
and forth. Godin tries to put the art of marketing into perspective. He shares a
lot of his own approaches and mental models. Really recommended in case you are
into this kind of domain specific knowledge.
