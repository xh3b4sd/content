I got into The Icarus Deception, written by Seth Godin. All things marketing,
but how it works under the hood. The narrative of this book is to picture the
creative process of persuasion as an art. An honest one. Art must be vital. Art
must create tension. Without tension no art. I really love the aspects of
systems thinking in parts. "Selling" anything happens under the law of the
connection economy in which only the infinite mindset wins. There are no zero
sum games to play because we connect based on a mutual premise. And if it does
not work, then it is ok. Because then, it might just not be for "you". But once
you cracked the code of making art you also understand that you do it for
somebody else. And when you can do it a million times, you might as well be able
to engineer a hype. I think you need to close your eyes in order to see the
magic of The Icarus Deception. This one is only for the dreamers.
