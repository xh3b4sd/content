I got into The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet, written by Becky Chambers. This
is the first one of a trilogy. A patchwork crew is set out to travel through
space and time in their tunnelling ship called the Wayfarer. On their way
through the galaxy the Wayfarer takes on a new highly incentivized job. The crew
strengthens their ties while going through several adventures and challenges.
Life is dangerous out there in the dark and the small, angry planet they are
approaching starts to cause a lot of problems. As with the other Becky Chambers
books the characters are extremely rich. The atmosphere and stories are full of
emotions. Chambers describes alien cultures and anatomies in great detail, be it
physically or psychologically. A couple of really cool things pop up in the
book. Intimacy plays a big role in the relationships between the characters.
Humans and AIs fall in love. Martians and Aandrisks find mutual support in
coupling. I especially liked the idea of how Aandrisks understand society and
family constructs so that I dreamed away imagining being one of them. Next in
the series is A Closed And Common Orbit, which I very much look forward to.
