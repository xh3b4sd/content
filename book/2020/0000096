I got into Call Sign Chaos, written by Jim Mattis. This is an autobiography of
Mattis' military career up to the point at which he resigned as 26th secretary
of defence of the USA under Donald Trump. Reasons were policy disagreements, and
who can blame him for that. His general sentiment expressed in the book is the
admiration and honour of serving the armed forces and the utter lack of
strategic thinking within the ranks of policy makers. Mattis seems to be a
remarkable man. The stories though did not give me too much, which is ok. One
thing that I got and which made that journey here worth it for me is this one
quote that he coined within his troops: no better friend, no worse enemy.
