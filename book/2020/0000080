I got into Fake, written by Robert Kiyosaki. Here we have an elites' trash talk
guide about how bad the elites are and how bad the swamp is. Too much Donald
Trump. Too much of the ever repeating primitives like the Dollar is not backed
by Gold anymore since 1971. My initial interest was actually to get a bit more
out of the narrative of fake teachers and his criticism of the education systems
goes into the right direction. But it doesn't help anyone to get bothered with
how much Gold Kiyosaki is bunkering abroad, just in case, you know. I got it
Robert. Thank you. Not worth my time. I dropped out after two thirds. Rich Dad
Poor Dad was kind of cool, but this was now my last Kiyosaki book for sure.
