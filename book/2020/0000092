I got into Antifragile, written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. I actually said I will
not get into more books of him after Skin In The Game, but I kept hearing how
important and ingenious the other books are. Taleb is not as condescending in
this one as usual but still very edgy and sometimes over the top. He cannot
convey an idea without telling you how educated he is or how uneducated somebody
else is. I am wondering why he needs that to make a point. Antifragile is
actually a pretty cool narrative, which goes along the line of chaos
engineering. Applying stressors to something in order to improve its vitality is
considered antifragile. The human body is antifragile to a certain extend. The
more you apply bearable stress to your immune system or muscles, the stronger
these become. That is pretty much it. There are big implications in all kinds of
areas of life. Mostly Taleb is hating about economists and bankers. One
interesting thing I found for myself is the thought that there is a great
asymmetry between benefits and accountability within the systems around us,
which effectively boils down to the agency problem and Skin In The Game once
again. Read at your own risk.
