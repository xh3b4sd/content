I got into Change By Design, written by Tim Brown. The book evolves around the
idea of design thinking, which is about an approach of thinking big and
wholesome. The idea is to look at systems and trying to figure out what they are
about and how their participants interact within it. Unfortunately the book is
from 2009 and thus a bit outdated on some topics. Would one have read this book
back when it got released and used the knowledge to buy stocks of for instance
Netflix, one could have made a once in a lifetime fortune. An interesting
thought I got from the book was that focus groups imply a serious confirmation
bias and can almost never lead to paradigm changing breakthroughs. As it goes,
don't trust the customers, they want better candles and horses. The book
suggested a lot of nowadays well known tools like Hackathons, Brainstorming,
Journaling, Drawing and Prototyping. All to decrease the feedback cycle of
tackling problems and getting closer to a viable solution. Another overarching
thought I quite like is that design is pretty much everywhere. No matter if we
look at DNA, games, organizations or software. Finally, design should aim to
reduce complexity as at least systems humans deal with tend to naturally
increase on that level, which makes lives only harder. The book did not really
blew me away but I am picky here. It certainly brought up a couple of
interesting ideas to think about.
