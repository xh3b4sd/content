I got into The Missing Billionaires, written by Victor Haghani. This book is
about the question why accumulated wealth often vanishes over time. One thesis
here is that understanding risk not well enough, more often than not, leads to
loss of funds. Another core issue in investing is sizing bets unproportional to
their respective opportunities. And then, bad spending habits seem to often eat
up more wealth than can be reasonably replenished over time. The authors propose
a practical framework about the expected utility of money. That framework
combines position sizing with consumption rules. The holistic view to investing
described here proposes a kind of portfolio construction that allows wealth to
compound, instead of allowing it to drift away. An interesting mechanism
mentioned here is the US spectrum auctions, where activity rules and
second‑price dynamics force telco providers to reveal the true values of the
auctioned frequency bands, which avoids the classic winner’s curse. Honestly I
expected something else from the book when it got recommended to me, and I found
it to be far too dry sometimes. I wouldn't recommend the book further, as I
found it to be too long winding in order to make a simple point. There are a lot
of statistics and experiments in here that may be of value to somebody else, but
at the time of listening to the audiobook, I wasn't very inspired.
