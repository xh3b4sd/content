I got into Bulletproof Problem Solving, written by Charles Conn. Solving
problems is all that humans do ever since. And yet, there doesn't seem to be any
reliable way to aquire solid problem solving skills. Problems are usually about
trade-offs. Many problems can't be really solved, and especially wicked problems
provide us with nothing but unfortunate options. Key to problem solving is to
defining the given problem most clearly. We often fail to solve problems because
we are unable to articilate them well enough. Having an insufficient
understanding of a problem will often only result in insuficient outcomes. Once
a problem is identified and specified, it may be broken down into its many
parts. Many complex problems require strategic execution of many well defined
actions, which all have to be executed in some kind of orchestrated fashion.
Problem solvers have to deal with unintended side effects, which means that many
problems have to be solved holistically. Problem solving appears to be more an
art than a science at times. And the book talks a great deal about various
examples, situations and approaches.
