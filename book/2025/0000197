I got into Governing the Commons, written by Elinor Ostrom. Governments do
typically hold this very strong belief that regulation is either about private
or government control, no matter the industry. The broad scheme of this book is
to address the concept of the tragedy of the commons. And in order to overcome
this fallacy, every system needs a robust framework to operate, a protocol that
prevents capture and keeps all stakeholders as far away from the extremes as
possible. There is usually no rigid top down regulation that allows an industry
to flourish, especially if said industry is new and underexplored. Resources
will always be captured if interests and capabilities of various stakeholders
are not aligned, because the power that can be exerted, will be exerted. Systems
that allow for experimentation and tight knit communities will usually end up
self-organizing based on the norms that those communities share. Policy makers
must be able to identify causes instead of symptoms, but most policy makers seem
to be too far removed from the realities on the ground, which is then often the
basis to ruin it for everybody. The topcis discussed in this book are super
fascinating, and it gets to show how far our societies still are from more
optimal governance solutions.
