I got into The Price of Tomorrow, written by Jeff Booth. The book doesn’t just
challenge your assumptions about inflationary effects within economics, but it
rather flips them upside down. While most people fear deflation as an economic
force, it might actually be the very thing that unlocks abundance for everybody.
The Priye of Tomorrow combines technology, economics, and human behavior. Our
current systems are obsessed with inflation, and they are dependent on debt,
while the unstoppable force of technology is fundamentally deflationary. What I
found most interesting was the twist of highlighting decentralization in the
sense of blockchain technology as solution to many of our structurally economic
problems. The book forces you to question what kind of future you actually want
to live in, and whether clinging to the comfort of yesterday’s economic playbook
will ever get us there.
