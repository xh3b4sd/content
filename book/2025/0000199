I got into Pattern Breakers, written by Mike Maples. This book is about founders
who win. Those people do already live in the future, as if a sea changing
inflection point is already unfolding. A recurring pattern here is that
successful founders must have an insight that almost nobody else has at the
time. And that insight must be contrarian to popular belief. For instance,
Airbnb made a bet that ordinary people would trust strangers the same way they
trust hotels. Uber focused on a new computing platform in order to generate a
game changing user experience, the smartphone. One other interesting idea
explained in this book is this. Instead of wasting a lot of time building some
product that nobody wants, successful founders get incomplete prototypes into
the hands of small audiences to see if anyone even cares. The book talks a great
deal about that one thing nobody can really put a finger on, product market fit.
It was quite interesting to listen to the audiobook. Would recommend for anyone
who is curious about the cilicon valley mindset.
