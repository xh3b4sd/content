I got into Narrative Economics, written by Robert Shiller. Shiller's basic
theory is that stories move markets. And the stories that we tell ourselves are
those very narratives that spread in similar fashion like epidemics do. We could
literally speak here about a form of mind virus, made up of a concept or a meme
that infects populations of people by mutating and replicating in unforseeable
ways. The spread of those kinds of ideas is then creating waves in financial
markets, fed by reflexive price movements. This book makes you think a lot about
systems that are dynamically exposed to human behavior. Some nifty hedge funds
seem to make a lot of money by incorporating measurements of narrative velocity,
looking at data that indicates how fast and how far certain memes spread. It is
interesting to think about how something like the headline of the day, or the
Zeitgeist of a time can take hold and influence behaviour on a global scale. The
book is fascinating in the sense that it basically asks the question how we can
build credibly neutral systems. For anyone curious about that, I would
recommend.
