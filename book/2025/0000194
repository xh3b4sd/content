I got into The Great Mental Models, written by Shane Parrish. This is the
edition about general thinking concepts. In order to understand the purpose of
this book, we have to understand the current state of our education systems. In
our day and age, children are conditioned to repeat well established facts
without asking further questions. The process of creating compliant individuals
is called indoctrination. And that has nothing to do with education. A more
desirable education system would rather focus children on ways of how to think,
instead of memorizing what somebody else believes to be true. And so mental
models rule everything around us. The way in which this book was useful to me,
was to find my own layers of abstractions within the stories of the book. The
author talks about a great deal of various mental models and provides a lot of
examples for how applicable those concepts are in the real world. But the real
inside that any book can provide you with, lies in the magic that you find for
yourself. I would recommend that book to anyone who just wants to get their mind
wandering in an abstract fashion. So that others may find their own magic along
the way.
