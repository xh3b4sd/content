I got into The Strategy of Conflict, written by Thomas C. Schelling. The
strategy within political conflict is about negotiation and competition in which
success hinges on ones ability to shape the opponent’s expectations about the
possible outcomes. For instance, players face the dilemma of making a threat to
appear credible, which often means to deliberately limiting that players own
options in the process. Another highlight here is the strategic value of
creating ambiguity instead of certainty. Implying more options than players
actually consider may force opponents to expend resources on problem domains
that are about to become irrelevant. Another argument made by the author here is
that victory isn’t necessarily about winning, as long as opponents can be
convincingly influenced to believe that their very own cost-benefit analysis
isn't likely to result in the opponents favour. In other words, conflict can
imply many different costs for the players involved, and the fundamental
question will be whether those costs want or even can be covered in the process.
Overall the audiobook was an interesting experience, triggering many provocative
thoughts about game theoretic scenarios in conflict and war.
