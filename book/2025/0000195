I got into Skunk Works, written by Ben Rich. This book is a biography of the
early stealth fighter and the methods of its development. The stories in here
are narrated through the eyes of chief architect Ben Rich. Rich's conversational
tone keeps the book entertaining with technical insights and his genuine human
nature. Skunk Works was a top secret research facility for military aircraft.
All kinds of innovations took place hidden from the eyes of the world,
redefining the rules of aerial combat forever. The main takeaway from what Skunk
Works represents is basically the absence of compromise when you want to deliver
the very best product. Those who lead the world into a new era do not care about
anything else. The audibook was fun to listen to, and I enjoyed the stories from
behind the scenes, given the historical context that we have today.
