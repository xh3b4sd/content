I got into The Theory of Money and Credit, written by Ludwig von Mises. Here we
trace the value of money back to its origins as an exchanged commodity. The
reasons for why money-like instruments became broadly accepted were grounded in
the hardness of those exchanged commodities. But over time ever more centralized
institutions implemented ever more dilluting rules that govern all of society to
this day. The author differentiates fully backed commodity money from fiduciary
media, like bank IOUs, that are not 100% covered by their respective reserves.
The book describes many aspects of the financial plumbing from the point of view
of a different era. The information age may one day enforce systemic discipline
using strictly rule based monetary systems so that political discretion cannot
simply borrow relentlessly anymore from the future. The book here is very
theoretical and in parts rather dry, but I figured that my mind started to
wander in all kinds of interesting directions while listening to the audiobook.
