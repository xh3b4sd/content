I got into The Tipping Point, written by Malcolm Gladwell. This one here was
actually Gladwell's first published book. For some reason it didn't kick me at
all. The book addresses facets of epidemiology and while the topic is
interesting I couldn't get a lot out of it. One intriguing idea reiterated here
was the theory of the optimal group size in highly social animals. This
principle is also known as Dunbar's Number, which is 150. So the theory goes
that the maximum amount of stable social connections humans can have is 150.
Several companies organized their structures according to that proposed limit.
The idea may be worth thinking about.
