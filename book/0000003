I got into The Dichotomy Of Leadership, written by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin.
This is the standalone successor of Extreme Ownership. The dichotomy is the
balance of opposing forces. Leadership is winning at all costs, which to
understand correctly and not rolling your eyes, you have to get into the book,
where there is explained in detail, what that actually means and how it works. A
little bit too militant. A little bit single sighted on war. Good insights on a
lot of aspects though. How to balance leadership and teams. What I got, amongst
lots of other things, is that every team member has to lead up and down their
own chain of command, all the time. I enjoyed that piece overall. Plus, it is
narrated by the authors. So you can enjoy the sound of Jocko's voice while
laying in bed.
