I got into Positive Poker, written by Dr. Patricia Cardner. Like The Mental Game
Of Poker, this one wasn't really about Poker. Here the author talks about brain
functions, habits, nutrition and conditioning. Not too much new and a bit out of
date. Also too USish where you apparently still have to tell people to not eat
so much crap. What I found interesting though where a lot of book suggestions on
very different topics. That was interesting. The book is a result of some
academical study concerned with the inner workings and aspects of poker player
in high performance competitions.
