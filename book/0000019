I got into Radical Markets, written by Eric Posner. The experience with the
audiobook was interesting. While listening I was often drifting away and got
lost in my own thoughts about the economic mechanics. The book is a bit lengthy
to make a couple of points. An interesting concept described was quadratic
voting. The performance of the narrator wasn't really impressive in the
audiobook I was listening to. The book is like 50 50. A bit special maybe.
Economic brainstorming that makes you often think: "this is not how anything of
this works". But what the fuck do I know.
