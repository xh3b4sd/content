I got into Crux, written by Ramez Naam. This is the second part of the Nexus
Triology. One thing that annoyed me right away was that the narrators change
between the different book parts. Two chapters in I got over it, but still. The
story continues right where the first book ended and does not lose complexity
but stays constantly thrilling. The idea of superior posthumans is propagated
more and gives the emotionally exciting plot a little spin of cyberpunk. The
chapters portrait different perspectives of two major story lines. One in the
American political sphere and one in the Asian social sphere. These story lines
are predicated by different characters and their pathways are more and more
intertwined throughout the book which centres on the pressing moral question of
ultimate power and its responsibility. Crux is a must when you finished Nexus.
