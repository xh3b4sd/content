I got into The End of Your World, written by Steven Gray. Gray calls himself Adyashanti. Why ever that is, I did not look that one up. The title of the book caught me so I just tried this one. The topic of "awakening" in a spiritual sense is pretty compelling to me as I am going through certain stages of development myself, while being more or less aware of it. At one point you are a person with a certain understanding of the world and in the next moment this understanding can kind of change completely. I think these transitions are things most people tend to miss out on because they just want everything to stay as it is, which is unfortunate for all of us. So this was my idea of the topic at least. Turned out the Author has an idea of awakening where you reach some idealistic final state. As far as I know this is not at all how the brain works. Listening further to the audiobook was quite painful as the book gets pretty ridiculous at some point. I stopped listening to the audiobook half way through because I couldn't bear it anymore. In the beginning there was this idea of getting more aware of yourself and the world and this is certainly what I agree with. But then you are talked into the dogmatic idea of being either totally enlightened or not at all and I do not buy this idea for several reasons. May the author have all good intentions but in my opinion this is not how anything of this works. We should maybe take everything with a little grain of salt, especially when people do not publish their ideas using their real names.
