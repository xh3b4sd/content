I got into The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck, written by Mark Manson. Some
wishy washy self help guide ranging from bullshit to cool. I personally found a
lot of views shared being way to US American. What I got from it though is that
your own value system counts and determines what success and happiness means to
you and how you may achieve it, or not. That it comes and can only be sorted
from within insight of yourself. That you got to pick your battles and
everything, at the end, is only about your own legacy. That what is left when
you are gone. It is only five hours and ok to tune in meanwhile.
