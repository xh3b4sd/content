I got into Man's Search for Meaning, written by Viktor E. Frankl. I heard Jordan
Peterson talking about it a couple of times and in the field of psychology it is
kind of a must read. The more I think about this book, the more it moves me.
Frankl, a neurologist and psychiatrist, survived all 4 concentration camps he
was held captive in. Half of the book summarizes a couple of situations he and
others went through during world war two. His focus was not so much on all the
cruel details, but on the situations circumstances and outcomes. Frankl is the
father of logotherapy which circles around the meaning of life itself on a
therapeutic basis. The book got extended by Frankl a couple of times until he
died. It is not very big, but one wants to take time for it. I think, I will
listen to it again at some point.
