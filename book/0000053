I got into Radical Candor, written by Kim Scott. This one is mainly about
company culture but provides in general some social best practises for operating
within groups of people. What sticks with me is the idea that you tell people
the bitter truth if you care about them, and not just sweet lies. Another key
aspect I took away is that real human relationships matter. Strong ties between
people make them trust each other, which especially in a professional
environment yields increased productivity. I did not get too far with the book
though. Scott narrates in the audiobook version and her voice is high pitch
aggressive and I could not stand listening to her voice any longer. It just
hurts and I couldn't really focus anymore. I felt like I got the substance
anyway as it was pretty repetitive at some point. So I quit after some time.
