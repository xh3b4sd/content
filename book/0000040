I got into Click Here To Kill Everybody, written by Bruce Schneier. Oli T
suggested it here a while back and I thought it might be interesting because I
heard about it in other places as well. Realizing the technological mess from a
security point of view is a bit depressing. Any electronic device is basically a
computer and any computer is hackable. That alone may not be a huge problem when
technology is used by qualified specialists. Almost nobody is specialized in
this field though and how technology is used by the public is ridiculous. Think
of credential stickers on monitors in hospitals. We might have a perception
problem here that the masses do not see the ROI in security efforts. It might
need to go horribly wrong in dramatic ways before something really happens. One
thought that struck be over and over again is that Software Engineers change the
world. Often in unwanted ways.
