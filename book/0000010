I got into Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, written by Neil deGrasse Tyson.
Listening to him at night is really cool. I like his voice a lot. The audiobook
is a no 4 hour ride through the universe and what we kind of know on a shallow
level. Pretty interesting though. Lots about the big bang, the elements we know,
our solar system, our galaxy, matter, dark matter, energy, dark energy, gravity
waves, you name it. Tyson has another book in store which I also have on my
list. Will check this out at some point.
