I got into 33 Strategies Of War, written by Robert Greene. This book walks you
through the armed conflicts best known to mankind while laying out the
strategies on which ground they were fought and won. Each chapter recaps such a
historic event and summarizes it with an interpretation based on not so famous
quotes from all kinds of not so famous strategic thinkers. This covers pretty
much everyone from the samurais to the romans. I am usually super cautious about
audiobooks that play longer than 10 hours and I quit this here after round about
17 hours when I felt like it doesn't give me anything anymore. Most strategies
laid out here are often about deception in zero sum games. So that was not
really appealing to me. Some key takeaways though. Moving fast increases moral,
but can be deadly when it gets out of control. One must always be aware of their
own limits, otherwise you lose yourself and your life in effect on the
battleground. When you like military history this one is for you.
