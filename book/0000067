I got into Chaos, written by James Gleick. This book is a pretty academical love
letter to the theory of chaos. It is about fractals, infinity and the problem of
never arriving. Everything appears to underly patterns of turbulences. From
biological processes in evolution to climate development on planets. Everywhere
there seem to exist tiny irregularities, but appearing in similar
representations. As such, simple systems can cause complex behaviour. In turn,
complex systems can cause simple behaviour. Behaviour itself may appear to be
expressed similar, while its accurate implementation remains unpredictable by
nature. This is why long term weather forecasting will never be possible. The
book Chaos provides a lot of historical background on the evolution of the
science of chaos in the academical world. Non-linear systems remain to be
unsolvable due to the nature of the butterfly effect. Turbulences and assumedly
spontaneous irregularities cause exponential changes of the trajectory of events
within any system. When you like it geeky, this one is for you.
