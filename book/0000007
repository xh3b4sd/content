I got into 12 Rules For Life, written by Jordan B. Peterson. Peterson itself is
narrator of the book, which I liked a lot. He is one of the most misrepresented
and misinterpreted personas I have ever heard about. He is a clinical
psychologist who published a lot of his university lectures on YouTube. The
biggest waves were made when he stood up against bill C16 in Canada. I do not
agree with everything what he says and thinks, but I am really fascinated about
how he says and explains something and when he talks you can be sure he thought
about that a lot in the first place. The book here is an incomplete guide for
decent being. All Rules are nice and make sense. It is inspirational. For my
taste too tightly coupled with biblical narratives. It is interesting at times,
but also a bit lengthy here and there. I liked is personal anecdotes about
parenting and other issues of the usual daily business the most, where the
topics at hand were explained by him based on psychological literature.
