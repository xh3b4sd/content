I got into Against the Gods, written by Peter Bernstein. This book is about the
historical context of risk management. Following the trails of great gamblers,
mathematicians and capital allocators, the book provides many insights in how
our understanding of risk evolved over the centuries. Here is one thing I took
away from the book. The law of large numbers predicts that the variance of the
standard error of a large sample size is smaller than the variance of the
standard error of a small sample size. That means that the larger a sample size
is, the closer is its approximation to the real value, whether that real value
can be proven or not. And here is another takeaway. Attributing bad luck takes
away from the individual's responsibility. We should therefore not just be
gullible, but instead always try to further our understanding of the underlying
cause and effect. I would recommend the book to anyone who has an interest in
finance. The stories being told here do not only explain how concepts like
probability work on a basic level, but also do so in a quite entertaining
fashion.
