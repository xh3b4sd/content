I got into Why Nations Fail, written by Daron Acemoglu. The book describes the
relationships between political institutions, economic systems, and the
prosperity of nation states. We get insights into historical examples like the
Spanish conquistadors in the Americas, the English settlers in Jamestown, and
the temporary rapid growth of communist regimes. The book shows how decisions
made by leaders and institutions shape the trajectory of their respective nation
states. One of the main takeaways for me here is the critical role of reliable
property rights within the rule of law. Without reliable property rights,
nations cannot prosper. It appears to be quite conclusive that extractive
institutions are the most singular reason why nations fail over time. Why
Nations Fail analyses many historic and contemporary examples of rising and
falling nations, and the common denominator amongst successfull nation states
are the empowering of individuals and the support of innovations. This book is
really good at showing how systems become successfull, how they stagnate, and
how they can be reliably predicted to disintegrate over time.
