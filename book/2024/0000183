I got into Bone Games, written by Rob Schultheis. Here we have the personal
account of somebody pursuing several endurance sports, most notably climbing and
running. I picked up the book looking for stories that push the envelop to show
how much human beings can grow beyond their self dictated horizon. Framing
outdoor activities as projects, the author describes several of his climbing and
running endeavours. The book goes a little bit in the direction of finding a
higher calling, almost like going to war with one's self. There are several
historical examples of spiritualism and shamanism explained. All of these
enlightening activities have a single thing in common, and that is suffering
beyond believe. When you keep running for hours on end, or if you wander the
desert for weeks without food, then your consciousness appears to submerge into
the collective experience of the universe eventually. Maybe the mind goes places
at some point, just to cope with the pain. What I liked about the book is the
vivid narration of the outer edges that somehow define the human condition and I
could certainly recognize my own search for struggle in here. I think it is
human nature to go to war with your own body and mind. Not to hurt or conquer,
but to find the light inside of youself amidst the darkest hour.
