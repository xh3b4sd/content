I got into The Road, written by Cormac McCarthy. I found this book looking for
stories of catastrophes, just to feel an approximation of that kind of pain. The
Road describes the death march of a father and his son, walking across the
dangerous paths of a ruptured world. The setting of the story is a little bit
like some post nuclear holocaust scenario. Father and son make their way towards
the coast of the south in search for resources and community. On their way all
imaginable dramas and atrocities go down, threatening their lives with every
single step they make. The dynamic of this truly loving father and son
relationship is so moving and heartbreaking because of the ruthlessness that
life requires when the rule of law has become not more than a distant memory,
and all that really matters on the streets of the survivors is raw, brutal
force. This book is an emotional summary of the human condition and a primer on
parenting from an apocalyptic lens. I absolutely loved listening to it and I
will certainly dig into more books from Cormac McCarthy.
