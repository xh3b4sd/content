I got into Same as Ever, written by Morgan Housel. This book is an ensemble of
various stories discussing the role of risk in life. Risk is defined as the
unknown. And I like that definition of risk a lot. Because by definition, the
thing that surprises us the most is the very thing that hurts us the most. One
focus here is put on the things that ought to be always true. That notion
resonated a lot with me because it is incredibly useful in business and finance.
In general the audiobook was nice to listen to but the book is minimally
impressive overall.
