I got into Broken Money, written by Lyn Alden. Overall the book is structured in
two parts. The first part explains the basics of what money is and how it
developed historically. The second part explains what Bitcoin is and shines a
light on many different aspects of its ecosystem. The first part of the book
explaining the history of money is really nicely written and a good
informational source about several intricacies that cause our moneys to be
broken. The second part of the book is in parts factual and in parts somewhat
biased in a way that makes Bitcoin and its ecosystem look better than it
actually is. We are here presented with everything that is great about Bitcoin.
For my taste the bad parts about Bitcoin's ecosystem are not too well
represented. And at the same time other cryptographic experiments like Ethereum
are not well represented at all. The book here is overall well spirited. Just
for it's length and detail rather unbalanced in how it represents the overall
cryptocurrency industry. To be completely honest I have hoped for more seeing
the book so hyped up everywhere on social media. But maybe that is just me.
