I got into Liar's Poker, written by Michael Lewis. This book offers an insider's
view into the chaotic and high-stakes world of Wall Street during the 1980s at
one of the era’s dominant bond trading firms, Salomon Brothers. The author wrote
the book as some kind of memoir, describing Lewis' personal journey from an
outsider with no formal financial education to a bond salesman. Liar's Poker
portrays Wall Street defined by immense risk-taking. Millions could be won or
lost within the blink of an eye. Salomon’s traders viewed risk as a pathway to
wealth, as if nothing else mattered in life. On the trading floor, it is "eat or
get eaten". Wall Street places a very high value on loyalty. On ethics not so
much. A phrase that I liked a lot going through the book is "my word is my
bond". But it seems that even those bonds eroded quickly amidst an environment
in which traders manipulate and deceive at all costs. Some would not even stop
from ripping off their own clients. Most surprisingly for me was that back in
the 1980s anyone could just show up and go through the psychological torture of
becoming a trader on Wall Street. No degree no nothing required. Those were the
days. For the most part, those days are over now in which traders could make
billion dollar decisions while lacking a fundamental understanding of finance.
Maybe we can summarize the book like this. If you want to find the seven deadly
sins, just follow the money.
