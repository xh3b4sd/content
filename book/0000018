I got into The daily stoic, written by Ryan Holiday. The book has 368 chapters,
of which each is around 2 minutes long in the audio book. That thing is
basically a collection of quotes and explanations what they might mean. The book
is not so much about the philosophical concept as rather a meditative guide for
a whole year. I scanned the book in three days and that was totally fine. It
made me think along the way and I got a bit from that. That was nice. I noticed
that Simon Sinek cites lots of the primitives described by the book when he
talks. That was like "aha!". I think Anna initially recommended the book at the
very beginning of this channel. So, thanks for that. I finally made it. <3
