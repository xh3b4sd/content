I got into The Renaissance Society, written by Rolf Jensen. The renaissance took
Europe from the medival age towards the path of enlightenment between the 14th
and 16th century. In comparison, The Renaissance Society tries to explain the
next leap in thinking and organising as human species. One take from the book is
that stories are one of our most powerful constructs. Monetary incentives alone
are not enough to make people work anymore, in a world of abundance. Therefore
we crave belonging and seek out to find something meaningful in the world. Funny
enough the book hints at decentralization and I would argue that DAOs are one
step in the ongoing evolution of capital coordination. The book wasn't too
exciting for me personally, but confirms many ideas I have about the future
trajectory of our world.
