I got into Projections, written by Karl Deisseroth. I am still so fascinated by
the author when writing this. Deisseroth appears to be one of the most ingenius
and at the same time most humble person walking this planet today. Projections
shares some of the stories that shaped Karl's professional life, as well as the
field of neuroscience itself. Andrew Huberman jokingly shares his impressions of
Deisseroth's professional character by claiming that Karl will one day win a
Nobel Price for his scientific discoveries. If that ever were to happen, then
rightfully so. Karl is one of the major forces pushing the frontiers of
optogenetics today. This rather juvenile field of neuroscience enables humans to
shift the behaviour of very specific types of neurons and cells within the
animal brain using photon exposure. The field, the person and the book are so
rich, so beautiful as such and provide each their own universe of opportunities.
The book tells some stories about the more severe cases of certain psychiatric
characteristics, like bolemia, psychosis, delusions, borderline and
schizophrenia. One interesting thought here was that humans are apparently the
only species known for the ability to cry. Why that is, nobody really knows at
this point.
