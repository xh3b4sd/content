I got into Don't Think Of An Elephant, written by George Lakoff. Here we have
some kind of dictionary for social concepts and their meanings based on everyday
language. The book is interesting from a standpoint of linguistic relativity,
but the chapters are rather dry, rooted in what appears to be the peak of the US
American empire of the 20th century. The book speaks mostly about framing in the
context of US American politics within the Deomcratic and Republican parties
respectively. One key takeaway here might be not to use the enemies language
since it appears to emphasize their world views. Framing happens by bypassing
the associations of the opposing party and trying to define a more sticky meme
within the population. Though the book got recommended to me, it was rather one
of the less interesting audiobooks I listened to.
