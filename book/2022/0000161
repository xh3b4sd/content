I got into The Evolution Of Desire, written by David Buss. This book provides
the latest research in human mating. Society has evolved following the first
principles of sexual selection, which is omnipresent, but only poorly
understood. In mating there are several challenges to overcome in order to
spread the genes of a lineage. Human mating, involves three major components.
That is finding a partner, attracting a partner, and often in monogamous
relationships, keeping a partner. The latter is especially important for females
of the human species. An interesting theory for instance in human mating is that
sexual jealousy is universal and evolutionary strategic. It appears that jealous
partners or proponents historically took measures to prevent succesful
implementations of mating strategies like mate poaching. A confirmation that I
gained for my own understanding here was that the dominance of the female role
in biology and society for that matter is far greater than it often appears.
Another interesting fact from the book was that about 10% of all male never find
a partner and that their lineage, after millions of years, ends with them. The
book is highly socio academical and full of facts. A recommendation for everyone
interested in the fascinating but dry results of today's academic research in
the field of human mating.
