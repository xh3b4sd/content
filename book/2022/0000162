I got into The Deficit Myth, written by Stephanie Kelton. A book about Modern
Monetary Theory. As I understand the basic principle, currency issuers like
nation states have a monopoly on money supply and can therefore, based on MMT,
not suffer from household debt, since more money could simply be printed. The
fundamental problem with issuance is how taxation is implemented. In today's
crypto economic experiments we already proof sustainable issuance models based
on free market principles. The crux in western societies as they stand today
appears to be legacy, causing everyone to suffer from inflation and debt cycles,
even though we know mechanisms to design systems that do not suffer from such
insufficiencies. What we do not know though, and this is based on the lack of
real world implementations of MMT, is what other side effects the population may
suffer from if MMT where implemented as theorized in this book here. The ideas
described here are fundamentally interesting for anyone curious about nation
state level mechanism design. During the time of listening to the audiobook I
found extremely interesting ideas about hyperstructures. Another interesting
idea in here was that taxes kickstart the flywheel of a currency because it is
the first demand generating mechanism within a currency environment.
