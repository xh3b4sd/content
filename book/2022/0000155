I got into Blindness, written by José Saramago. One of the rare fiction books I
ever got into so far. Based on how the story starts out and how gripping it
develops into the midst of the book, the end came so abrupt and disappointing,
and left so many questions unanswered, I am in stark pain right now writing
these lines. I am just wondering why the author do me like that. So spoiler
alert, basically all mankind gets blind and after some time can see again,
leaving the world behind in pieces. The meat of the book was giving hard
concentration camp vibes. The government around the protagonists created
detention camps for everyone who went blind in order to prevent spreading the
blindness epidemic that nobody understands. The life of the detainees is
portrait in minute details. Here you get a deep dive into mayhem, waste, power,
rape and murder. I appreciated the depth of the book which reminded me heavily
about Man's Search For Meaning. There are great opportunities for reflection of
one's own fortunes and burdens. May it help reconcile the issues we face during
these trying times. The parallels to a pandemic environment and alternative
realities were startling. The book is not for the faint of heart and everyone
waiting for some kind of reasonable end is going to be very upset. I am grateful
for the experience here but would have expected way more class from the story at
the finish line.
