I got into Inside The Black Box, written by Rishi Narang. The book provides an
overview of quant trading. That is the automated, data driven approach to
managing money in an adversarial trading environment. Interesting here is the
idea of trading model design. An automated trading strategy is conceptually
broken down into different models, each responsible for different aspects of a
trade. Here we have the alpha model, risk model, cost model and execution model.
In that way a trading strategy can be designed and implemented while focusing on
what is important on each of the different stages of a trade. Another
interesting insight in the book was data sourcing. Data is the input for any
trading strategy and data has to come from somewhere. Data has usually to be
prepared before usage in structure and quality. Data sourcing is usually
expensive, because data is vast and comes at a costs to fetch, store and use.
Inside The Black Box is a really nice book if one is interested to get a glimpse
at the world of quant trading.
