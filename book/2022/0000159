I got into Think Again, written by Adam Grant. In this book the Author speaks a
lot about cognitive development and behavioural patterns that cause outcomes in
our private and professional lives to dramatically vary. The point here might
simply be that we are all biased all the time and that it sometimes takes very
little in order to break through these biases in order to live a happier life or
become a better professional. An interesting takeaway from here is that more
productive conversations appear to be more emotionally complex. Conclusively
narrow minded conversations may target a particular audience or aim to force a
certain agenda. Another fascinating idea is that people are often stuck in their
identity based on what they think they are. This is the implementation of a
fixed mindset. It is not important what somebody is. What is more important is
what somebody does and cares about. Deflecting from being and focusing more on
potential may make people base their identity off of core values instead of some
rigid idea of the past. The book provides a lot of ideas and insights for
trainers, educators and anyone who wants to widen their own horizon.
