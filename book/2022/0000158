I got into Breathe, written by Rickson Gracie. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu would
probably not exist without the Gracie family. Rickson is one of the most
important champions of this very way of the warrior. This biography describes
Rickson's life, what it means to be Gracie, and what it means to Jiu-Jitsu.
Rickson embodies an unbreakable will to fight. To this very extend, he pours his
heart, his soul and all of his life into the art of war he studied ever since he
could stand on his own two feet. The book is very touching and emotional.
Rickson's energy is palpable in every chapter. He does a very good job
explaining what Jiu-Jitsu means, and means to him in particular. Calling it a
sport doesn't quite cut it. Jiu-Jitsu is a marshal art evolving and expanding
like it has never before. A lot can be learnt about life, game-theory,
self-defense, spirituality, body and mind, when studying Jiu-Jitsu. It is just,
that not everyone is willing to take the painful lessons it requires in order to
understand what there is hidden within the war against yourself. Every child
should train on the mats and discover new horizons. Lessons worth a lifetime can
be captured by controlling your own breath under the pressure of a stronger
opponent. Lessons like humility, respect and the value of life itself. I enjoyed
the audiobook a lot, following the path of one of the most impressive
individuals of our time.
