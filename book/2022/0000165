I got into The Culture Series, written by Iain Banks. This series consists of 10
books, amounting to an audio experience of almost 143 hours, which is about 6
full days of story time. The Culture Series describes a future universe in which
a high technology civilization is being run by powerful machines called "Minds".
These minds usually inhabit space ships or orbitals of which each has different
responsibilities and capabilities. One charming feature of the books is that the
Minds give themselves descriptive names that reflect their own characteristics
in a humouristic way. And so you follow along teh adventures of "Size Isn't
Everything", "Not Invented Here" and "Sleeper Service". Ships and main
characters of the story often cross paths or come out of the Culture's
intelligence agency "Special Circumstances", notoriously believed to be involved
in intergalactic interference between species. Almost all of the books were
bingeworty to me and at the end of each book I was just left mesmerized in the
dark filled with wonders and dreams about potential and colour of the worlds
described here. Hands down one of the most compelling science fiction literature
I came across so far.
