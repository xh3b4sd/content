I got into The Timeless Way Of Building, written by Christopher Alexander. The
author was an architect by profession. Writing my thoughts here now I just
realized that while I was listening to the audiobook, Alexander passed away in
the age of 85. The book is basically about some form of wholistic urban design
theory. Some interesting ideas are discussed, while the essence of what
Alexander tries to explain could not put in words to the point. The whole book
uses examples of city design, street design, house design, really any design for
places where people live. Architecture and design here is described using event
patterns and pattern languages. The idea of abstracting space and objects within
it using events, patterns and languages designed to describe these properties of
any spacial system were pretty fascinating as such. Though the book itself was
somewhat hard to listen to for me during that time. Just like a park bench or a
peach tree, present at the wrong time of the day, deprived of sunlight or
flooded with wind at a time when it is most important to get this kind of
configuration right, maybe the time of listening to this audiobook was poorly
timed on my part as well. Anyone being interested in the most abstract form of
mechanism design and the architecture of activity may find The Timeless Way Of
Building very useful after all.
