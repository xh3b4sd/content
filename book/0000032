I got into Superintelligence, written by Nick Bostrom. I did not enjoy that
piece too much. Too long. Too "smart". Too theoretical. Too worried about the
future. Weird was also that this seems to be a guide on how to enslave machines
and I do not like that sentiment. Interesting was in parts how truly intelligent
machines could be developed and what it takes to get there.
