I got into AI Superpowers, written by Kai-Fu Lee. Lee is kind of a public figure
in the world of AI research. Once under top 100 most influential people on the
planet. The book is pretty cool. A little bit Silicon Valley with dragons. One
thing is for sure, China is just a different world. The pace at which the
country develops and rebuilds is insane. Kind of cool, but side effects and
implications are all questionable. China is the richest country on earth when it
comes down to real data. While granny in Germany pays bananas with the good old
coin, WeChat is used to pay more or less everything by hundreds of millions of
people. There are cities being build from scratch fitted for autonomous driving.
The second third of the book gets pretty personal and Lee talks about the human
part of the world and what is important in our lives and that the digital
evolution has to merge with it. Some alternative ideas for society are
discussed. Like universal basic income, which is also questionable as I more and
more notice.
