I got into The Power Law, written by Sebastian Mallaby. An absolutely beautiful
must-read for anyone interested in venture capital. The book walks you through a
lot of the most (in)famous success and failure stories of modern venture capital
and its underlying dynamics. The power law describes an exponential distribution
in a Pareto sense, where the few carry the many. And even though Silicon Valley
is not the only hub for venture capital anymore, only few players generate the
overwhelming amount of returns over time, like it is a law of nature. So many
interesting stories and principles are discussed in The Power Law, from the
beginning of venture investing to the more modern ways of allocating capital in
startup businesses. This one might be worth revisiting at some point in order to
draw another set of inspirations and different points of view.
