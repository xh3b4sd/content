I got into Option Volatility and Pricing, written by Sheldon Natenberg. The book
explores various options trading strategies using established statistical and
mathematical models. It underscores the importance of understanding market
dynamics wholistically and acknowledges that models are abstract representations
with limitations. Like the saying goes, all models are wrong, but some are
useful. The book is quite technical and mathematical, and in its audiobook
version not a great experience.
