I got into Your Brain Is A Time Machine, written by Dean Buonomano. The title
might be a little bit misleading. In essence the book discusses how the human
brain operates within an environment in which time plays a major factor. There
is a lot to be said about the neuroscientific implications of how humans
perceive and deal with the continuous flow of time. For instance the timing of
neural patterns plays a key role in reacting to stimulus. The brain recognizes
certain time delays and mismatches in expected timing of for instance lip
movement and heard sound when somebody is talking to us. A particularly
unpleasent case of timing failure can be experienced during video calls nowdays
if audio and video are not synchronized well due to connection lags. I found the
book quite interesting when it talked about the evolution of different time
measuring techniques. Overall quite an interesting read.
