I got into Invent and Wander, written by Jeff Bezos. This book is in parts a
collection of Jeff's annual Shareholder Letters, and in parts Jeff's own
recollection and summary of his life and journey building Amazon. The most
outstanding parts in the book to me were small nuggets of Jeff's own learnings,
like one of his most famous principle: always day one. He also wrote that
cleverness might be a gift, but that kindness is a choice. And in that light we
should all choose kindness more often. Another takeaway for me here was a
question asked during the hiring process: will I admire this person working
together? And then Jeff said that he lives under the principle of regret
minimization. When he will lay on his death bed, he does not want to think back
and regret having or not having done something in his life. I really liked the
audiobook. It was also free to download. So there is no reason not to give this
one a try.
