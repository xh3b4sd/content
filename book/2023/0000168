I got into Shape, written by Jordan Ellenberg. I guess I expected some more
inspirational or mind blowing content. The book here contains a lot of
historical references and prose that I did not care about at all. Towards the
end I skipped most chapters because I did not see much of a connection to
mathematics anymore. It started off somewhat interesting with geometry and
epidemics, but it somehow got old for me real quick.
