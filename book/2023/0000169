I got into Deep Thinking, written by Garry Kasparov. In this one Kasparov
revisits the most relevant games of his career in relation to his most notable
computational opponents. The premise here is that technological progress never
stops and that once technology claimed its throne in any given domain it appears
to be impossible to get the genie back into the bottle again. Kasparov's domain,
the game of chess, is arguably solved as so far that no human can outcompete a
chess program anymore. One game analysed in the book stood out to me in
particular. There was an instance of Kasparov eventually sabotaging himself
because of the confusion that his opponent Deep Blue created within him during
said game. There have been and are still a lot of controversies around Deep Blue
and to me it looked like it wasn't a sovereign chess player at all. It rather
appeared to be some highly specific strategy replay engine that got fed and
tweaked constantly with static data in order to adjust to changing game
dynamics. The book turned out to be quite interesting overall.
