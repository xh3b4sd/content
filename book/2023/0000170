I got into A Thousand Brains, written by Jeff Hawkins. Hawkins is an
entrepreneur and neuroscientist working on innovative forms of brain theories.
His ambitions centre around solving artificial intelligence. The first two parts
of the book are extremely interesting, where Hawkins describes his view points
and mental models with regards to his latest research in neuroscience. The third
part of the book had a different flavour that I did not find too compelling for
my taste. In any event, Hawkins and his approaches are really fascinating and
worth a read.
