I got into The Case Against Reality, written by Donald Hoffman. Hoffman
challenges the conventional view that our senses provide an accurate
representation of objective reality, which, as he claims, they do not. Hoffman
argues that evolution has shaped our perceptions not for truth but for fitness,
guiding us toward actions that enhance survival and reproduction. That is an
extremely interesting thought and begs the questions how human perception may be
faulty to the extend of not realising the simulation around us. The book
explores the implications of this idea, touching on topics such as perceptual
illusions, the nature of consciousness, and the role of virtual experiences in
our lives. The audiobook quality is extremely bad, if not annoying. Donald
Hoffman has some interesting ideas and the Lex Fridman podcast might be a good
spot to dive into all of that.
