I got into How To Invest, written by David Rubenstein. The book is a summary of
investing anecdotes and principles, featuring insights from interviews with
finance legends such as Ray Dalio, Marc Andreessen, and Larry Fink. Rubenstein
distills principles from successful investors, emphasizing the importance of
culture, patience, making the right decisions in the moment, compounding over
time, the ability to stand alone against the current, and the value of reading
and writing. The book covers diverse investment areas, from venture capital to
crypto, providing a transformative guide for both novice and seasoned investors.
Bonus interviews with Bill Ackman, Jim Breyer, and others add exclusive
perspectives to this authoritative audiobook experience.
