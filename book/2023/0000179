I got into The Price Of Time, written by Edward Chancellor. This audiobook
explores the history and impact of interest rates on economic and financial
systems. Chancellor traces interest from ancient Mesopotamia to the present day,
highlighting its role in coordinating capital. The book challenges the
assumption that low interest rates are always beneficial, arguing that
excessively easy money leads to financial instability. Chancellor connects low
interest rates to asset price inflation, weak economic growth, rising
inequality, zombie companies, and pension crises. The narrative spans global
credit booms, negative interest rates, and the consequences of easy money in
China. The book warns of the risks and fragility in the financial system,
emphasizing the importance of understanding interest to navigate future
challenges. Overall a great book describing the systemic risks we are facing
across time.
