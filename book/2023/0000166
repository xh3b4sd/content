I got into Transformer, written by Nick Lane. A book about bio-chemistry,
particularly about the Krebs Cycle. Also called the citric acid cycle, this
bio-chemical reaction chain is responsible for what is being called cell
respiration. Dumbed down, glucose, or just "food" getting into the body and
eventually getting to the cell, is broken down into its molecular properties.
Single atoms are then turned into hydrogen, which is loaded into cell membranes,
enabling the cell to generate energy and and certain amino acids. The book is
quite fascinating, discussing possible origins of life on earth and basic state
of the art understanding of cancer cell growth.
