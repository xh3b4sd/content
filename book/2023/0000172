I got into The Laws of Trading, written by Agustin Lebron. This book explores
the nuanced interplay of human psychology, focusing on the influential dynamics
of greed, fear, and the often-overlooked element of self-deception in shaping
trading decisions. The book delves into the concept of trading as a zero-sum
game, also known as the dark forest, examining the competitive nature of
markets. It offers insights into human decision-making, uncovering biases that
can impact judgment amidst the dynamic nature of trading environments. The
author underscores the significance of self-awareness, encouraging readers to
uncover and understand their own biases and emotions. This book is valuable not
only for traders navigating financial markets but also provides insights for
improving decision-making skills across various life domains.
