I got into Jude The Obscure, written by Thomas Hardy. The book describes a man's
life in an England of the 19th century. Jude, in pursuit of intellectually
stimulating scolarships is trying to fight for a better tomorrow. The crude
reality of a still almost medival mindset across societies of the time keep
harassing Jude and his ambitions. Going through the motions, Jude meets Sue, who
becomes Jude's daylight dream and nightmare at the same time. Emotional terror
is tearing Jude apart, and despite all blood, sweat and tears given for a more
bitter than sweet life, Jude is carrying on in pursuit of his dreams, never
letting go of Sue inside. In the harsh reality of two centuries ago, Jude dies a
broken man, teaching a lesson about cruelty and grid. The book is a fantastic
contrast to the modern world. A story that can certainly enrich ones horizon on
many levels.
