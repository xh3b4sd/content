I got into The Age of AI, written by Eric Schmidt. A is an exploration of how
machine learning is reshaping human society, comparable to historical shifts
like the Enlightenment. The impact of this very technological advance on
knowledge, politics, and warfare is predicted to be profound in ways human
history has never seen before. From showcasing examples like chess mastery to
medical breakthroughs, the book serves as a crucial roadmap for understanding
the present and envisioning an unprecedented future. There is a focus on
dynamics of nation state power structures, defense, and cybersecurity,
addressing the tension between AI's promises and the threats it poses. The
looming concern of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) surpassing human
control is a central theme, highlighting the delicate balance between progress
and existential risks. "The Age of AI" provides a concise yet compelling
exploration of AI's transformative promises and the inherent dangers it poses to
humanity.
