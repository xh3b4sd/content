I got into Outliers, written by Malcom Gladwell. The author is also the speaker
in the audiobook. The point being made is that success and loss in life can
mostly be predicted by the environments circumstances. It goes along the theory
of nature versus nurture. For instance, your chances to become a professional
ice hockey player goes towards 0 when you are born in the latter half of the
year. Almost all professionals in this field are born between January and April.
This is due to the selection process in the system and small differences young
players have in their early years due to a couple of months of differences in
physical and psychological differences. The book portraits more examples like
this. It shows that there is a privilege given to lucky ones. That enables
success for people becoming high performers based on the right timing and hard
work. Further, it is then actually everyone of us creating opportunities for
others, that then accumulate over time and change the world forever. I liked
this piece a lot.
