I got into The Infinite Game, written by Simon Sinek. The message of this book
is really important IMO and in parts the book makes a good job on explaining the
matter. The finite vs the infinite mindset is about two opposing ideas or world
views if you will. It is about winning vs developing. It is about destination vs
journey. It is about achievement vs process. This means that "best" is worse
than "better" in a lot of situations. See Pareto's Law. All this, obviously,
depends on the context and the game you are playing. The finite mindset tends to
lose in an infinite game. Sinek makes his case that life for instance, or
business is an infinite game. You cannot just win in the game of life. You
cannot just win in business. This is simply because these things do never really
come to an end and what then rather counts is a sustainable idea of how to play
the game. After the game is before the game and only betting on one big hit will
not achieve anything in almost all cases. The book derails a little bit at times
and swings back to be somewhat interesting again. So the book is rather 50/50
but its message is brilliant. Go get some.
