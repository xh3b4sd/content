I got into The Culture Code, written by Daniel Coyle. I love this one. The
author researched for this book a couple of years and interviewed high
performing teams in all kinds of different fields. NBA teams, diamond robbers,
Navy Seals, Restaurant owners, movie makers and so on. The book describes what
high performing teams have in common, what drives them and what kills them. Lots
of examples are provided based on real life situations. A concept called
belonging cues is described. These are created by signals of communicating
individuals. Wild and dynamic cross signalling within teams is a good indicator
that correlates with high team performance. Belonging cues are created to
establish sympathy by leveraging all kinds of aspects of body language, empathy
and how something is actually said. You need a strong foundation for belonging
cues, which is a safe place where people feel welcomed and appreciated, even
when raising difficult concerns. A place in which you can de-breathe in military
terms. There are no ranks, no titles, no egos. Important is to transport ideas
like: "tell me what you need and I help you", "you are part of this team", "we
have high standards here", "you can reach these standards", "we go through this
together". Another interesting aspect, amongst all the others, is the concept of
catchphrases teams establish within their internal vocabulary. A short and crisp
saying expressing a specific sentiment transporting specific values. You know
some of them: "get after it", "go get some", "keep grinding", "have fun", "let's
roll", "work hard, be nice".
