I got into Preaching Through Pain, written by Arthur James. I was expecting
something totally different and was a bit disappointed with the book itself.
Turned out the book was really about real preaching. Written by a preacher, for
preachers. I am not a godly man and do not know who James and David and Abraham
and Isaac and Jacob and Joseph are and I am also not interested in where the
great lord touched Arthur and how he is speaking to him. I wanted to skip the
book after the first chapter but thought I could make it an exercise for myself
and listen to opinions I deeply oppose. Preaching through my own pain so to
speak. I found the prayers in each chapter hilarious but I feel like I should
not laugh about it. What cracked me up was the energy he was putting into it and
it felt like some performed standup comedy at times. There were a couple of
interesting thoughts though. First, you should not get too attached to everyone
coming and going through the revolving door. Second, it is very very difficult
to cultivate a compelling vision among people and build up trust at the grass
roots. Preaching is like priming yourself, which I do myself every day in the
scope of another side hustle. But I do it in an unreligious and instead a rather
philosophical way. The book is not a real recommendation from my side. I am glad
it is over.
