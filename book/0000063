I got into Ego Is The Enemy, written by Ryan Holiday. Here we got a pretty hard
pill to swallow. The author shares stories of people we saw rise and fall
throughout history due to their self consumed human nature. Being able to see
rationally through the foggy imagination of one's self is difficult, if not
impossible. Ego makes the mental fog thicker and almost insurmountable. It
hedges a neat bed of mediocrity, stifles development and isolates us from having
real human relationships. Ego is a shield, more often than not preventing real
good happening to us. As difficult as the topic is, as difficult is the solution
to the problem. It is likely all about perspective and awareness. The crux here
is, the blind can't see. You need to want to see. You need to want to listen.
You need to want to understand. And then, you need to want to work on yourself.
