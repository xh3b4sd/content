I got into The Mental Game Of Poker, written by Jared Tendler. This one is
actually not really about Poker as such. More about what tricks your mind during
the game and how to overcome that. A more practical guide explaining what really
matters. Quality over quantity. One bigger topic in the book is tilt. Tilt is a
phenomenon everyone experiences everywhere as it reflects a mental condition in
which we more or less lose control over a situation and deeper instincts take
over our actions. Preventing this, providing training ideas and how to manage
tilting situations is a big deal the book is concerned with. I liked it so far.
