I got into The Obstacle Is The Way, written by Ryan Holiday. This one is
basically The Daily Stoic continued, but going with more recent stories around
our time. I found the end best where there is basically a Tim Ferris Podcast
with Holiday. The acknowledgements at the end as well as further book
recommendations where also interesting.
