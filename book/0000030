I got into Born Standing Up, written by Steve Martin. Martin also narrates the
audiobook and I liked that very much. I even lowered the speed to have more to
enjoy and take time for the chapters. It was unfortunately not too long. I
enjoyed listening to Martin greatly. It is more like a biography and makes you
laugh and smile once in a while. I am not sure I "gained" anything from the
book, but I just enjoyed it. The more disappointed have I been when the book
just ended and I think how the book ends is also pretty unfortunate. That could
have been made better IMO. But what the fuck do I know. And yeah, he is already
super old.
