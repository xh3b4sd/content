I got into Factfulness, written by Hans Rosling. You may already know him from
some TED talks and his bubble charts, showing how the world developed. This book
is, as he says his last attempt to fight the negative sentiment people often
tend to have when looking at the world and where it is heading to. I got really
flashed by his stories and his data. He is an outstanding character. Got around
the world. Highly respected by decision makers around the globe. Brought me to
tears a couple of times. Really made me feel it. Amazing. He divides the world
into four different income levels. Based on data, Africa and Asia is going to
dominate and define the global market consumption in the coming decades, as they
climb the income levels. Another key takeaway is that the world's population,
based on currently projected life expectancies will stabilize around 10 to 12
billion people until the year 2100. He uses a lot of data and charts to describe
and proof his statements. I enjoyed it greatly.
