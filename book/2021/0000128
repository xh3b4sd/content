I got into Fooled By Randomness, written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The essence
of this book is that we are way more biased in our every day life than we are
able to comprehend. Like the difference between science and scientists, where
science is very precise and does not leave too much room for interpretation.
Though scientists are humans and subject to their own shortcomings, leaving them
to interpret science in their own ways more often than not. Studies suggest that
more than 80% of the people think they are better in any given discipline than
50% of the population. Life and its events may simply be random results of cause
and effect. And yet people recognize faces in rock formations on Mars. So the
quest for finding the signal amidst the noise may not be more than a lie to
ourselves. One interesting thought I took away from this book is that it may be
good to ignore path dependencies and approach every day as a clean slate. It may
not be too important how much signals are out there, given there are any. It may
simply be about navigating through life. And that is then maybe also why things
that do not make sense do in fact work after all, and things that do work do not
always make sense. We often mistake the information we have at hand as full
picture of reality, even though what we know is barely a fraction of what is
really going on. Not falling for your own fool may be the best advice here. I
enjoyed the audiobook and can recommend.
