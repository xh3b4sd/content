I got into Misbehaving, written by Richard Thaler. This book is mainly about
behavioural economics from the point of view of Thaler's career. He provides a
rundown of for him remarkable advances in behavioural economics which he more or
less participated in. The book is not particularly thrilling, but insightful on
the subject matter. One realisation I made is how academical fields have been or
still are so much behind in terms of system's thinking. Like professionals are
stuck drinking their own kool aid for decades. It is no wonder the saying
"science progresses one funeral at a time" bears so much truth in it. A key
takeaway for me here is that cooperation rates of advanced players in common
goods problems tend to fall towards zero. I took the opportunity to learn a bit
about defectors and coordination problems. For the latter we appear to have more
tangible solutions depending on the system design at hand. Thaler was often
exposed to policy making on regulatory levels, where options and accountability
are often limited. In any case the book may be a good resource of inspiration
for a certain problem domain.
