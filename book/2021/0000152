I got into The Ethical Slut, written by Janet Hardy. This book might be one of
the most foundational resources about human relationships I have ever come
across so far. With this book you get the chance to question what is even real
about our understanding of social systems. Society teaches us one pretence after
another without most people ever questioning them. The Ethical Slut could be
categorized as a book about polygamy, but this term alone is so inflated and
diverts in meaning for every other person that it doesn't pay justice to the
complexity of what we encounter as friendship and love. The bottom line here
might be that there is very little right or wrong when it comes to real human
relationships. And while there is a lot of potential for people to do harm to
other people, this book sheds a light on various alternative lifestyles. Anyone
being interested beyond the idea of a man and a woman forever being happy
together finds a vast treasure trove of inspiration and insight right here. One
of the takeaways I have is that everyone has to unlearn jealousy to some extend.
We would all be better off if society could teach a lot less shame and
insecurity within the vast sea of opportunity that we call life.
