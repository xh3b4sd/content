I got into Reminiscences Of A Stock Operator, written by Edwin Lefèvre. To me
personally the book was rather long and boring. Very historical since the
stories play out around 1900. The book is pretty anecdotal and so most stories
told were not telling me much or were inherently irrelevant to me. Something to
take away from here was that the stock market, and maybe all financial systems
are full of manipulation and insider trading, no matter the regulatory
framework. The way in which whales develop a market is often very vicious,
because markets are made to appear in a certain way that creates exit liquidity
for the insider. It is kind of funny that Livermore, the protagonist of the
biographical stories, traded himself to be rich and broke multiple times. The
idea of making and breaking it throughout one's carrier is kind of fascinating.
Though I wouldn't have needed to go through the whole book for these kind of
ideas. I was basically waiting for some piece of wisdom up to the last minute of
the audiobook.
