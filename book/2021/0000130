I got into Metahuman, written by Deepak Chopra. A lot of philosophical aspects
influence this book. So this one may be rather sudo scientific. The word meta
means "beyond" in greek. The gist here evolves around the idea that humans can
experience some form of awakening. Awareness is rather a spectrum that sentient
beings may travel along while they go through live. So there is not this one
state or form of awareness. We all operate in a world of incomplete information,
up to the neurological level. When we grow up all we know and all we are aware
of is our own individual social reality. We do not know how the colour green
looks like for somebody else. We do not know what the word love means for
somebody else. And we do not know, what consciousness is after all. So the idea
here is to break out of the captivating framework that you call life or reality
in order to discover what may be hidden behind your own priming. Chopra says to
be meta is a choice. He provides ideas around how to practice to become meta
conscious in the last chapters of the book. Ideas that I found fascinating were
for instance the theory that time and space do only exist in consciousness. That
plays along the lines of us being in a simulation. Maybe in our own simulation.
I found some resources around these ideas and wrote about it myself. Mainly to
process these ideas and theories. I take the content in here with a grain of
salt but am certainly intrigued by anything that may expose my ego's hidden
agenda. Just as your heart is a double agent, your consciousness might be the
single agent connecting all of us. The book made me think, and I like that.
