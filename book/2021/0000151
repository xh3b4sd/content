I got into Einstein's Unfinished Revolution, written by Lee Smolin. The book is
about highly academical details of general relativity and quantum theory. The
author Lee Smolin is theoretical physicist. He provides his own view and
explanation of his field of expertise across time. A lot of basic principles are
tried to be explained. The topics discussed are just so complex and mind bending
that it might be hard to follow through for anyone not being acquainted with the
matter. The gist for me as with most physics books is this, we do not understand
the inner workings of our universe at all. Nobody can explain what a particle is
supposed to be, why it apparently moves like a wave, what even a wave is, or if
particles are in fact the smallest possible building blocks of existence.
Regardless the astonishing breakthroughs in understanding more about the nature
of physics as we define it, we still seem to be so far away from understanding
and being able to describe accurately what we perceive as the fabric of space
time. The audiobook is actually pretty good, even though the content is
intellectually extremely heavy. May it inspire the next generation of scientific
research.
