I got into Humble Inquiry, written by Edgar Schein. I love the book because it
brought a profession closer to me that I am not that good at somehow. The book
is all about communication and human psychology. There are sometimes situations
in which you already know the answer, but have to ask in a way that reveals what
is really going on. The way we ask questions often determines if we are able to
connect to people or become more distant to one another. Humble inquiry is a
practice. It means to take time to establish a connection and build a real human
relationship with the other person. Humble inquiry means to notice when we go
too fast. It means to go slow before we lose ourselves. Way too often it happens
that we respond to people with our very first emotional reaction. And way too
often it is so incredibly hard to be aware of what is about to go down while we
operate at a high pace with one another. Awareness of our environment and
awareness of the role we play at any given point in time is so important and so
incredibly difficult to achieve and maintain. I couldn't draw any particular
technique from the book that could help to become more aware. So it may be a
matter of deliberate training. We got to sharpen the sword after all and it may
be that everyone has to find their individual triggers to break through the
cycle of ignorance. Humble inquiry is about behavioural agility and so I want to
become better at that. Challenge accepted.
