I got into The Practice, written by Seth Godin. As with other books from Godin,
this one is about the art of doing. How to get started, how to get along, how to
achieve goals. The book is more or less a list of smaller anecdotes, each about
a certain aspect of a given craft. The book may be rather inspirational about a
diverse set of topics and analogies. Here is a random one: lifeguards leap
first, whether they are sure or not. Maybe certain disciplines require us to go
through the motions in order to create something like magic along the way. Magic
will certainly not just create itself out of nowhere. So what it takes, is the
practice.
