I got into The Most Important Thing, written by Howard Marks. A kind of bible of
financial investment. There are actually a lot of very important things,
especially in investing. Everything depends on context, strategy and risk
profile. One must consider markets as cyclical organisms. There is expansion and
contraction like with a beating heart. Being guided by signals of the market
cycle unfolding can help inform moving forward. If risk and price move together
one must consider when to get in and when to get out. The most simple thing to
get right is to find an opportunity that the market got wrong. If the market
neglects an opportunity then prices are low as well as risk. Focusing on the
future and having an idea about the direction of the world can help making the
right investment decisions for the decades to come. As a vision unfolds, limited
downside meets unlimited upside. Getting in early is then vital to not coming
late when you then have to buy high again, because coming late means high risk
again. It is often more important to prevent doing the wrong things as compared
to always doing the right things. Nobody can always do the right thing. Though
everyone can try to not getting wiped out. A single final blow might be the end
of your investment career. Marks often refers to the books of Taleb like
Antifragile and Black Swan. I can recommend reading all of them, even if Taleb's
character might make you want to shoot the messenger. Don't shoot the messenger.
Not this time.
