I got into The Untethered Soul, written by Michael Singer. This book can be
classified to be from the genre self help guide. Singer describes the need for
self inspection. That means to try to understand how our internal systems work.
Most people have for instance an internal narrator voice negotiating with them
on a constant basis. Understanding what this internal narrator has to say and
why it is saying certain things makes us often realize that this ever present
voice is merely a reflection of our very first emotional responses to our
environment. People live on a spectrum of psycho reactivity and while we have to
navigate the world there is often a need to strategically silence umpulsiveness
in favour for long term thinking. In order to counter behavioural reactionism
Singer describes a lot of meditative techniques that help to listen, understand
and silence the mind. The topic itself is pretty important, though I did not
like the book much and skipped a bunch towards the end.
