I got into Toxic, written by Neil Nathan. This is the first time I couldn't find
a proper website about the author. All I found was garbage. Regardless, the book
is a treasure trove for chronically ill patients. The bottom line is that the
world we created is full of toxins that make living for a lot of people
unbearable. Chronically ill patients have often nobody who takes them seriously
and there is often nobody who can help them with the various problems these
people suffer from for years. Nathan specialized in treatments of mold toxicity
and lime disease as well as all kinds of neurotransmitter related diseases. The
complexity of the human body and biochemicals we are exposed to every day is
mind boggling. Anyone suffering from hyper sensitivity or toxicity is in for a
long ride of detectives work to figure out what is actually wrong with the body
and the current environment. Whoever shows symptoms of chronic diseases finds a
lot of studies and references in this audiobook. The message here is, don't give
up, you can figure it out, even if nobody appears to understand.
