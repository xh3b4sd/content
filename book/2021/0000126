I got into Am I Being Too Subtle, written by Sam Zell. The book tells the story
of Zell, who is an exceptional entrepreneur and philanthropist which most people
never heard of. Zell immigrated to the US when his parents escaped the Nazis
during the time of the second world war. His father was entrepreneurial and Zell
started to become a deal marker himself early on. Starting out in real estate
Zell soon became interdisciplinary across different industries. Throughout the
book, Zell tells his story, putting an emphasis on his core values. In fact the
whole book is a testament of Zell's character. What all of this here comes down
to is this. Everyone can make it if they want to. Success is a decision. Success
is a lifestyle. Success is to trade one for the other. When listening to the
audiobook I thought that there are so many interesting and noteworthy people out
there that you only hear about when chances of working with them are low. Maybe
this means to take a bet on what you have. Maybe this means to take a bet on
what you do not know. Maybe this means that the dark forrest out there is way
darker than we think. And maybe this means that you just got to make a move. I
recommend Am I Being Too Subtle to anyone who needs a compass.
