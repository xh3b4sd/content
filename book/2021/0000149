I got into The Ascent Of Money, written by Niall Ferguson. A historical and
anecdotal summary of what money is and how it came about. The main statement,
money is trust. Whatever people collectively believe in having value will be
valued collectively. Money is a medium of exchange that guarantees the
redemption of value due to various contracts. Historically monies have been
IOUs enforced by social contracts. Later in human history written law guided the
exchange of value. The information age brought smart contracts into the game,
which the book fails to incorporate. Nonetheless The Ascent Of Money is pretty
interesting and provides some fundamental understanding of how debt is being
leveraged for wealth creation and how insurances and banks came to be.
