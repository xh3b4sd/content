I got into Alchemy, written by Rory Sutherland. This is one of the most funny
audiobooks I listened to so far. Sutherland narrates his book himself and did a
really great job at it. Alchemy for me was one of these eye opening best sellers
that change your world view in a certain way. The narratives described evolve
around the idea of psychology really being about psycho-logical phenomena. The
book shows that very often things that make sense do not work, and that in turn,
things that do not make sense work very well. One example is that being rational
provides you with a rather weak position in negotiations. That might simply be
because uncertainty creates risks for the other side. Forcing the opposing party
to either become irrational as well, or to defend themselves, puts you at an
advantage in zero sum games. I felt like Sutherland is the likeable version of
Nassim Nicholas Taleb. One thought I liked to pick up throughout the book was
that feedback mechanisms are critical for any system. Since complex systems,
like the human mind, have a myriad of feedback mechanisms it is no wonder that
the waters gets muddy real quick. And that is then maybe why placebos work while
we have not a single clue why that actually is. There are a lot of different
inspirations about the human psychology in this book. So anyone interested in
the physical value of things and their underlying psychological meaning will
find an inspirational treasure trove with this one.
