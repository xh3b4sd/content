I got into Who Controls The Internet, written by Jack Goldsmith. This book is a
little bit dated, which is no wonder, because everything within the internet
develops at an unprecedented pace. Goldsmith describes the illusion of
decentralization, promised by the very fundamental ideas of internet networks as
they were initially designed. In fact the digital space is rooted within the
physical space, and the physical space, after all, is governed by nation states.
This is why governments have immense influence over ISPs, IXPs and any form of
monetary and social exchange happening on digital platforms within their
jurisdictions. The book here walks us through the history and ascend of internet
infrastructure and its controlling entities. Most interesting for me were
comparisons between western and eastern civilizations. Where the internet of the
United States of America have been guided by a more free form of expression, the
internet of China is guided by means of more control and regulation. The latter
goes as far as preventing access to certain online services and removal as well
as prosecution of government critical speech. What is fascinating is to observe
these more or less decentralized systems over time and how their narratives tend
to converge. This is for instance why in complex systems, especially of social
nature, minorities often dictate rules for everyone. That is true in the west,
as well as in the east, see cancel culture. Another curious inside here was that
government usually works by "cost and bother". Since total legal control is
practically impossible, government often only needs to make an example of a few
cases in order to keep the majority of actors aligned by risk of threat.
