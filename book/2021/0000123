I got into The Fourth Turning, written by William Strauss. The core idea
described in this book is that our societies evolve in cycles. There are four
cycles repeating themselves in our history books. At the time of writing the
book, the world, or more specifically, the US was in the third cycle. Now, at
the time of writing this post the world is in its fourth cycle. Based on the
cyclical theory we get closer to the end of the fourth cycle. History showed
over and over again that massive changes erupted throughout the world at the end
of every fourth cycle. It is quite interesting to think about our world in that
light and what it might mean for us during the years to come. So many people are
crying wolf for years already warning about the current system to collapse. In
times of endlessly printed money and completely irrational markets it is not
hard to imagine that the system cannot sustain itself forever as is. I totally
like the idea of the book. The book itself was rather focussing on the US and
was not too compelling to me for that matter.
