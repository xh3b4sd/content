I got into Shoot For The Moon, written by Richard Wiseman. The book here takes
you to the NASA missions that brought mankind out there into the dark. Every
step on our way to the moon was primed by the characters of ordinary people, who
managed to go beyond what was once believed to be impossible. One thing to take
away from here is to better prepare for all eventualities. If you come
overprepared and nobody sees you coming, your chances of success rise
enormously. So what the space crews and engineers did during their Apollo
Missions was to ask a very simple question, "What if?". These people trained for
any yet so unrealistic case and accounted for scenarios that after all, never
happened. And only due to this very conscientiousness we managed to bring humans
to the moon and back. There are many stories of many contributors described in
the book. Listening to all of them gave me more than once goosebumps. The
courage of individuals, stepping up to the task when life is calling, is what
makes our collective an unstoppable force. Any mission can become a success, if
after a hard day of work people can honestly say "if it does not work out, it is
not because of me". This book is a recommendation for anyone who loves the
thrill of a shared mission. I for once teared up following along this
spectacular journey.
