I got into The Game Changer, written by Jason Fox. The book is a primer on
motivation and collaboration. When people come together in order to better a
common cause there are hurdles and pitfalls to be aware of. All the human
capital may go down in wasteland if you do not take care of it. At first it must
be easy to participate. Creating a level playing field is therefore of utmost
importance. Enable collaboration and you can harness the energy people want to
bring to the table. Once people are on board they need to have the feeling that
their contributions matter and in fact move the needle. Communication and
transparency is then critical for joined ventures in order to not bury the
progress where nobody can find it. One takeaway here is that people crave
responsibility. Give people a reason to die another day, and they will make use
of the next 24 hours aligned with that reason. If people are able to buy
themselves in they out of a sudden become responsibile for their own actions and
the collective they participate in.
