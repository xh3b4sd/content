I got into The Alchemy Of Finance, written by George Soros. The audiobook is a
rather short theoretical elaboration on some mental models that Soros
contemplates on. One of his arguments is that there does not like equilibrium
exist in financial markets or complex systems for that matter. It is rather that
a system adjusts itself into an ever changing balance. Financial markets appear
to be inherently reflexive. That means that there is always a complex reaction
to any given trigger event and the reaction itself causes ripple effects
throughout the system. Reflexivity may cause a system to go back and forth in
waves but may or may not do so in unpredictable ways. The Alchemy Of Finance is
pretty interesting from a theoretical point of view and intentionally does not
serve as investment bible.
