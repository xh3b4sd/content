I got into Noise, written by Daniel Kahneman. We know the author from Thinking
Fast And Slow. The audiobook for Noise is a bit dry, even though the topic is
really interesting. The idea presented is that where there is complexity there
is noise. It made me think of MEV because it is that where there is complexity
there is MEV. In that light noise is potentially caused by a lot of different
circumstances. In human systems there is for instance bias. For instances judges
sentencing accused are found to be biased depending on how hungry they are. The
book speaks a lot about how to measure error in statistical systems. As there
has to be a great body of data in order to find noise and its causes. For the
interested there is system noise, pattern noise and level noise, amongst others.
May that be useful for somebody one day.
