I got into The Psychology Of Money, written by Morgan Housel. The book is an
average summary of the classical best practices of retail investing. First,
investment strategies are always individual because everyone has individual
needs, goals and foundations. One of the classics is to be patient and to let
compounding work its wonders for one's investment. Another classic is to reduce
costs in order to increase efficiency of the capital one has. The moral of the
story might be that the happiest people understand what "enough" means to them.
The happiest people may managed to not move the goalpost anymore. Appreciating
what one has and being able to live on one's own terms might be the greatest
wealth one can achieve in life. Anything beyond financial freedom may be more
attributed to greater aspirations which are not really required to live a good
life. And then, what success means is subject to everyone's own definition.
