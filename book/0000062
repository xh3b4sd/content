I got into What You Do Is Who You Are, written by Ben Horowitz. This fantastic
book is all about culture From prison gangs influenced by Shaka Senghor to a
world dominated by Genghis Kahn. Horowitz analyses cultural leaders and their
principles to get a better handle on successful initiatives that can make all
the difference for a business. It is important to understand that culture is
domain specific. What works for Google, may not work for Facebook. What works
for Slack, may not work for Boeing. The narrative at Facebook once was "move
fast and break things". When you build airplanes, this might not work out that
well. People often have nice ideas about culture, but don't know how to
implement it and make people effectively living up to it. What you think your
culture is like or should be is then actually not that relevant. The crux is how
others bring the culture you desire to life. How your people implement culture
is what counts at the end of the day. And then, culture is not a static thing
that you have to get right once and for all. Culture is like a living creature.
It breathes and develops. Every day. When you fall short on your own paradigm,
people will pick it up, twist it, turn it and make something out of it you never
anticipated before. The book here was super exciting. It made me more aware of
what I have, what I need and what may be important to others. Horowitz talks a
lot about hiring and firing. He describes accurately what to look out for in
people. How inclusion helps to conquer the world. How road blocks stifle
decision making and promotes indifference when you just stand in the way. All of
that resonated pretty well with me. "What You Do Is Who You Are" also perfectly
blends into the regime of "The Hard Thing About Hard Things". 100%
recommendation for everyone giving a shit.
