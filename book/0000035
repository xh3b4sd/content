I got into The Art Of Learning, written by Josh Waitzkin. Puja recommended the
book and I liked it quite a lot. Waitzkin is Chess World Champion, Taiji Push
Hands World Champion and BJJ Black Belt. The book expresses a couple of ideas of
how learning works. Everyone can do something pretty good. What people need is
the environment to let that happen and make it real. We are all fish and want to
swim. We only need to find our sea in which we can swim. What children need is
"good" parents. Waitzkin has amazingly supportive parents as it seems and their
competence to let their child figure out what he is good at and then supporting
that path in any imaginable way is what we should all have had and provide.
Waitzkin narrates the book himself and talks you through his own carrier in that
sense and what he came to figure out along his way. Really interesting. In parts
I found it a bit boring when he elaborates too much on certain Push Hands fights
which did not really transport anything for me. Or maybe I didn't get it but
there was one chapter I kind of skipped in the end. The audiobook version has
also a pretty shitty Tim Ferris Podcast version attached. I did not listen to
that because the audio was really fucked up. Like in a phone Hangout session
while driving through a tunnel. I enjoyed the book though.
