I got into Skin In The Game, written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The idea behind
having skin in the game is really compelling. Having skin in the game means to
have close contact to reality and to be exposed to the consequences of one's own
involvement in it. The book starts out promising over the course of the first
chapters. I was attracted to ideas about symmetries in life and decentralized
responsibilities. One note went like this. On the federal level I am
libertarian, on the state level I am republican, on the local level I am
democrat and on the family level I am socialist. The degree of differentiation
and consideration of scope and scale and their implications in turn within a
system was really revealing to me. I liked that little spark. Another one is
that systems evolve via negativa, which is by subtraction. Though when you
google it the results are rather depressing. As such developed the book. The
style in which things are explained is condescending and cynical. I did not like
listening to it in the end and was just hoping for another spark. One learning
from that could be that style matters. Now I am not too excited getting into
Taleb's other books to be honest. I think I am done here.
