I got into This Changes Everything, written by Naomi Klein. The worst book I
ever listened to, bah. A 20 hour panic piece of ever repeating headlines. The
topic is climate change and how bad we all are. All options to tackle it are
talked down and no alternative or idea is suggested. She just goes you are bad,
you are bad, and you too. The only thing I learned is about Solar Radiation
Management, which is about a terraforming approach involving blocking sunlight
from reaching the earth. Like, you can shoot even more particles into the
atmosphere and darken the sky, just like volcanoes. And yes, this is a bad idea
as well. I got a bit angry at times and this one was the first I skipped whole
chapters. I also do not agree that it is the fault of "the 1%" or our "leaders".
All bullshit. We all have that burden to shoulder. Everyone of us. Blaming
somebody else is a nice idea, but does also not work well to solve a problem.
Not recommending that book.
