I got into 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, written by Yuval Noah Harari. He is
a cool speaker in several discussions out there. The first third of the book was
really cool. A lot about possible future developments and challenges. It is all
about biotech, data science, engineering and the transcendental path humanity is
heading towards. Later the book got into a more worrying sentiment about our
future and which roles religions and ideologies play when it comes down to
address the bigger problems of our time. The end suggested a self improvement
approach on the individual level using meditation. It is a bit ironic that Harai
himself sticks to the only meditational approach he ever knew and never tried
something else, where this kind of dogma is what he actually calls out on
mankind. He has two more books which are somehow a series all together. I think
I will check this out.
