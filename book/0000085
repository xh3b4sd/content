I got into How The Mighty Fall, written by Jim Collins. After his book From Good
To Great, this one here boils down to all the poisoning traits a culture may
develop. Collins describes 5 stages of decline but I found that might not be
applicable in all cases of destruction. So you got all the characteristics of
unhealthy organizations. Organizations where people are that complacent that
they think they are too big to fail. Organizations where people are that
entitled that they think they deserve to be number one tomorrow because they
were it yesterday already. The book describes the fall of a couple of gigantic
corporations which do not exist anymore or are barely a shadow of themselves.
The book did not thrill me really, but it left some thoughts and impressions on
me. One is that people often tend to responsibly gather together only to let
their responsibility dissolve in the group implicitly assuming the group will
sort it out. But in that sense a group as an idea cannot be responsible for
anything. The people have to realize their own responsibility and not get
trapped in that counterintuitive believe that the group will sort it out. It
will not. The people have to. Something for me to ponder on a little bit.
