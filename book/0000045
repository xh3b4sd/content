I got into Nexus, written by Ramez Naam. Several people recommended this so I
got interested even though I was a bit shy for fiction in the first place. I was
not let down though. I was actually surprised how much I liked this kind of
fiction. Being used to more factual books, this one is pretty thrilling. The
world that opens up in your mind was very compelling to me. Story line is pretty
much a synthetic drug called Nexus developed by some smart ass kids. Nexus gets
into the brain and uses synaptic connections for logic gates and at this point
the mind becomes a technically enhanced computer enabling people to connect like
we do all day via the internet. Amazing opportunities open up and the developers
quickly become the person of interest across the board. Drama, infiltration,
money, sex, mayhem, death, politics, friendship, love, education, crime and
enlightenment. The book has everything to make you feel. I got so attached to it
I often had tears in my eyes waving through that universe. It kicked me so much
I couldn't put it away in the night. And another chapter. One more. Only one
before sleeping. Ok, the last one for tonight. Now really. I am already into
Crux, which is the second book within the trilogy. If you are into cyberpunk,
this one is for you.
