I got into The Book Of Why, written by Dana Mackenzie and Judea Pearl. An highly
academic history of statistical correlations and causal models. It was really
hard for me to go through it and it is probably a really bad audiobook because
matter of the content are a lot of algebra and formulas I did not follow at all.
I could have perfectly lived only with checking the last chapter where the real
point is made. The book is leading in an argument for causal models in machine
learning and artificial intelligence research and that machines will never be
able to understand the world without them.
