I got into As A Man Thinketh, written by James Allen. That one had a bad quality
and did not really connect with me. It was too dry. Allen apparently narrated
the book, which is weird, because he died back in 1912. The audiobook was just
an hour. I got the recommendation from some Tim Ferris book list so I thought
"let's try". I got one thing from it though. Serenity, its importance and the
effect of time on the mind. That was interesting.
