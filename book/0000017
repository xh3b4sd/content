I got into Clean Meat, written by Paul Shapiro. The book is pretty unstructured
and rather a single blob of information. The topic is super interesting to me
though. The premise is basically that we can manufacture all kinds of animal
products in order to improve whole industries. Adidas has a fully synthesized
spider silk show. Since the 90ies we humans produce insulin using modified yeast
bacteria. We can already grow diamonds. We could to the same with gelatine,
leather, foie gras, milk, eggs and meat. Cellular agriculture is a pretty
exiting industry on the horizon of the next decades.
