MEMO W02 JAN 2024

As it was already priced in, the BTC spot ETF got finally approval from the SEC.
Two days after the approval there was a repricing event and over 100B of total
crypto marketcap evaporated again, which is hanging in there around 1.75T.

In concert to the BTC ETF approval, the speculation of an ETH spot ETF made the
rounds. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, took it upon himself to inspire high hopes
with his ideas about tokenization of all financial markets. ETH/BTC did actually
pump beyond 0.061, making everyone believe this was the ETH/BTC bottom.

On a more personal note, I got scared shitless towards the end of the week when
I saw almost all macro charts printing ATHs. Another realization that got
emphazised this week was that the previous bear market ended in June of 2022,
which, as of time of writing, was about 18 month ago. So arguably we are almost
2 years into the bull market now and retail hasn't even showed up. Regardless,
it begs the question in which environment we are in right now and how the sea is
going to change moving forward.
