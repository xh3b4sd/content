Our world today is complicated and somehow we never know how reliable our
governing systems turn out to be. Companies make us believe that their products
are good, when in fact they are not. Governments make us believe that their laws
are good, when in fact they are not. In the advent of optimally designed
blockchains, we created new systems with incredible properties. One of those
properties is immutability, which means that nobody can change it anymore.
Immutability enabled a new paradigm called "code is law", which means that any
emergent behaviour is right and true. This post intents to explain why "code is
law" matters.
