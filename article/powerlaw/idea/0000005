Talk to anyone out there and you may come to the same conclusion. The systems
governing us, all around the world, are broken. Software breaks every day. And
when it breaks, we fix it. What we are somehow not fixing are the systems that
define how we live our lives every day. The games we are playing collectively
can only ever be as good as the rules that tell us what we can do and what we
cannot do. This post intents to describe better rules for better games.

Nation states require a set of rules that their citizens agree to operate on.
The documents defining those rules are usually referred to as constitutions. It
is very hard to create or change the constitution of a country. Historically,
creating a constitution implied the re-construction of a country after losing or
winning a war. Changing the rules of a constitution usually requires a
meaningful supermajority of the ruling class. This described form of fundamental
governance has served us fairly well in the, so called, civilized world.

Governance is the thing that we need. Politics is the thing that we got now
instead. Governance and politics are two different things. Here is how both
terms are defined by Wikipedia. First, governance is the process of making and
enforcing decisions within an organization or society. It encompasses
decision-making, rule-setting, and enforcement mechanisms to guide the
functioning of an organization or society. Second, politics is the set of
activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms
of power relations among individuals, such as the distribution of resources or
status.

Governance appears to be a technical and neutral process. Politics on the other
hand appears to be the struggle for power to control that process. And there is
nothing neutral about it. Politics is about the privilege to decide who has
what. That sounds oddly familiar now, doesn't it? Here is another definition
from Wikipedia. Theft is the act of taking another person's property or services
without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the
rightful owner of it. In summary, at the pinacle of human civilization, we
engage in political elections in order to decide who is allowed to steal from
everyone else. And oddly enough, the human condition makes you deny those crimes
and all its evidence in front of you until you yourself become the victim of
that very system. This is then the point at which nobody can agree anymore on
anything. This is the point at which we are seemingly right now. Because all we
did politically was messing with other people. But wait a moment. Let's take a
step back.

Pick any human endeavour, raising a child or a family, investing money for
yourself or for others, ruling a city or a country. All of these endeavours have
at least one thing in common. They all require decision making. All kinds of
decisions have to be made all the time for all kinds of reasons. The difficulty
in anything we do in any given context, is to solve for two distinct core
issues. Namely "Who should make this decision?", and "What is the best
decision?". The societies we live in do often provide answers to those core
issues, not based on merit, but rather based on historical and cultural
contexts. Because, it has "always" been like that! Regardless the historical and
cultural context, we can say that those core issues are always addressed by
comittees, where the respective comittee consists of 1 or many members.
Generally speaking, N of 1 comittees are usually very right or very wrong in
their decision making. Respectively, N of many comittees are usually very
mediocre. The reason for our generalized N of 1 performance is the fact that a
single individual can be specialized and to the point. When an arrow hits, it
hits hard. From there it follows that when an arrow misses it does not hit
anything, which is especially unfortunate if your life depends on it. The reason
for our generalized N of many performance is the fact that many individuals
together have to make compromises in the most literal sense of the word. They
have to compromise themselves, and thus the group. No outstanding result can be
expected from a compromised system. That does not mean that the system has to
fall apart, but it dictates that life doesn't have to be that great either. The
mediocrity of comittees rules everything around us. Because, [the majority is
always quite average, by definition].

If we wanted to be benevolent we could say that N of many comittees allow to
provide relative stability, which we have benefited from in the western world.
Though, what we also have to say, is that relative stability rarely comes with
extraordinary progress. And that becomes particularly important over long
periods of time. It may work out for a decade or a century, but if history tells
us anything, it is that [the fourth turning] is never far away.

Democratic systems today concentrate power in special interest groups, parties
and governments. There is a relatively small footprint on a headcount basis
across those entities, meaning, democratic systems are fairly easy to corrupt by
targeting small groups of individuals. Over longer time horizons the effects of
lobbying and self interest potentially take a hold in systemically meaningful
ways. This is about mechanism design. The code our democracies run on today is
written down in our constitutions. While they serve us relatively well compared
to other systems, they are still meaningfully broken by design. And we have to
change that. At the moment there exist significant power concentrations around
the ways money is created, collected and spent. This power concentration is
naturally prone to corruption because of its underlying centralization. Our
checks and balances are good and great, but none of them prevent wealth
debasement, household deficits, government misspending and efficiency decreases
all over the place.

An idea for improving our governance systems would be to modify the value flows
within the underlying monetary and fiscal institutions. If taxes go into one big
honey pot that is ready to be exploited, then we end up in the place we are in
right now. At best, get rid of the honey pot. Stop blindly collecting more and
more money from individuals and stop blindly spending it in the naive believe
that more money is able to solve problems. Not a single successful business is
run like that. The citizens of a region should be allowed to allocate at least
50% of their provided taxes to local causes in ways they see personally fit
based on their individual and independent judgement. Take out a map, find the
point at which you live, draw a 100km circle around that point. This is where
you can allocate 50% of your taxes. No questions asked. No postal code areas
that change every year based on voter preferences. Pure capital allocation where
the domain experts see fit.








A Opportunities versus outcomes ,

We might say that opportunities get us towards capitalism and outcomes get us
towards communism.

opportunities are created for a broad set of personas
by applying a simple rule, outcomes are created for specific people by applying
a complucated idealogy,

No matter which system you choose you always will have competition and the
question you should be asking is on which level we should be wanting to compete
against ... yeah well, against who actually?


bigger government implies less competent citizens, and that is not good, less
competitive, less revenue, less profit, less growth, more dependence, more
centralization, less constraints


the constraints are defined between government and citizens, even though we want
to optimize for the health of the system, if the system is the objective, it
cannot be the constraint, and what actually matters is that the people do well
