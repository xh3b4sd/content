# SKIN IN THE GAME

prediction markets

wisdom of the crowds

I heard Polymarket bars US citizens to use the app, while US election markets
have the highest liquidity at stake. One take might now be that there is not
much truth revealed in markets for which participants have no skin in the game,
because the people betting on Trump are actually not able to vote for him.


The more important question to ask for me is how we frame and state the rules of
a market that is to be bet on. It is super critical that everyone understands
what they are betting on and what the rules are.


sports betting, studies are mixed, not enough data

amazon five star reviews

financial markets as prediction markets

would be great to have a statistical analysis of polymarket history, what is the
ratio of markets resolving in the direction of the majority bet?
