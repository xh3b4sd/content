# THE HARDEST FUCKING THING

> Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program. - [Milton Friedman]

We live in a society in which almost everything is about money. And as with
everything, money exists on a quality distribution. That means not every money
is created equal. Some money is better than others. We refer to the quality of
money as hardness. The best money is therefore the hardest possible asset. In
the context of finance, this post intents to explain why hardness matters.

The common medium of exchange today is [fiat money]. And whether we talk about
the US Dollar, the European Euro, or the Argentine Peso, those fiat currencies
are all not more than paper bills of almost arbitrary value. The issuing
institutions of our every day money have the monopoly of violence within the
confines of their respective jurisdictions. And since our economies rely on
financial debt in order to grow, our ever increasing household deficits will
eventually have to be financed with more paper that the government will print
whenever there is a need.

I just found this nugget in a podcast. That picture explains the widening wealth
gap in the global financial system to me. The rich get richer and the poor
remain poorer on a relative basis. The widening gap between the orange line and
the dotted line is the wealth gap. The dotted line shows consumer prices.
Everything gets more expensive for everyone. But people who own hard assets like
gold, crypto, real estate and equities like tech stocks increase their wealth
disproportionately. And it appears that all that wealth increase can be boiled
down to central bank liquidity, which is used to finance nation state debt. And
there is a lot of debt because we live in a debt based world. So all there is,
is really just the widening of that gap and what that means to me is that you
better own the hardest asset possible in order to float on the same level as
liquidity does.


The laws of physics obtain the property of unbelievable hardness. Based on our
current understanding, gravity cannot be dilluted, space cannot be exploited and
time cannot be manipulated. The consequence of this hardness is that we can
heavily rely upon physics. The same is true for mathematics. We can build
something according to the laws of physics and mathematics and rely upon the
predicted behaviours of that application. This is how we harness electricity.
This is how we build computers. And this is how we encrypt data. Our ability to
develop and use technology has given mankind the defining edge throughout
history. On an evolutionary scale, money has been utilized as a form of
coordination technology. Money enabled us to allocate capital in order to be
better tomorrow. And this is what we did ever since. For the sake of keeping it
simple, let us not focus too much on all the complexities involved when
determining what money actually is. In fact, money is a lot of things. For our
purpose here, let us simply say this much. Money enables us to buy whatever
somebody else is willing to sell. So the act of trading one thing for another is
fascilitated by money, where that one thing must be valuable to both parties
involved in the trade. Exchanging value requires us to store and transfer that
value over time. And we can say that the hardest asset is the very money that
stores the most amount of value over the longest period of time. Time is the
ultimate enemy of anything that aims to retain value. Because we are once again
competing aginst the laws of physics. With every passing year, and every passing
century, everything in this world may change in unpredictable ways. And hardness
is the very property that allows any money like asset to stand the test of time.

On a human time scale we can say that real estate has been a pretty hard asset
for many people, with the caveat that real estate is immobile and at times
illiquid. Those two unfortunate properties may cause tremendous harm to real
estate, if its value cannot be made liquid when its owner needs that value the
most. War is a pretty devastating thing if your home gets seized or destroyed in
the process. And real estate markets become ever less liquid the more likely the
prospects of war become in any given area. Gold has been a pretty hard asset
over the centuries as well, and many continue to believe in its hardness to this
day. The problem with gold is not so much that it can be destroyed like the
house you want to live in. The problem with gold is rather that it is difficult
to move if you own it yourself in physical form. Owning significant amounts of
value in the form of physical gold is highly impractical. And chances are that
it gets seized or stolen, if war comes knocking at your door. Only a century ago
[Executive Order 6102] was signed in the USA, forcing citizens to turn in most
of their gold based assets during the Great Depression. Henceforth, americans
had been prohibited from owning arbitrary amounts of gold for over 40 years,
until the limitation of gold ownership was repealed in 1974. That story says
something about the great democracies we live in. And [all we can take away from
this life is that there is no rule or law, but what you can or cannot do].

It is fair to say that nothing is harder than time itself. Regardless, our
approximations under the use of technology start to become closer to the hardest
possible assets ever created. This is where we make the case for blockchain
networks and their native tokens, most notably BTC and ETH. We have begun the
age of digital assets now. They are global by nature. Digital assets are not
simply confined by nation state borders. They are always liquid, and if managed
properly, almost impossible to seize. Though, digital assets do admittedly only
exist for a mere 15 years by the time of writing. And that begs the question how
reliable those technologies can in fact be at retaining any amount of value, if
their [Lindy Effect] today is still very limited. In my mind, what we are
witnessing here is the purest form of technologically enabled economic
compression we have ever seen before.

Economic compression is a protocol for harnessing the sudden release of
accumulated action potential. It happens that somewhere in the economy this
action potential increases over time. And approached at the right moment, it can
be taken advantage off in order to gain an individual productivity increase. The
goal is to realize more value in less time by compressing progress. For
instance, working in a startup compresses the experience of a career. Investing
in digital assets compresses the understanding of money. Adding weight during
sports compresses the effect of fitness, and so on. Economic compression reduces
multi decade efforts down into a couple of years time, or even a moment's
notice, resulting in productivity increases that are sometimes extraordinary. In
my mind, that is what we are doing with blockchain networks today. We are
compressing the network effects of innovation and increase our abilities to
capture its value. And we do it better and faster than ever before. This is the
case for the hardest possible asset. BTC and ETH are the most liquid, most
durable and least corruptable assets, which makes those assets the hardest
fucking thing in our day and age.

Let us look at those three dimensions, liquidity, durability and corruption.
Liquidity is important because you need to be able to exchange value for what
you prefer in the moment. Making real estate liquid takes a fair amount of time,
if there is even a market for your real estate when you need it. There might not
be any sufficient buyer for your real estate when you want to sell it. Making
reasonable amounts of gold liquid does only work if you are not owning the
physical yourself. And in that case all you really own is a receipt from the
issuing custodian that promises to give you the money for your gold when you ask
for it. Most of the time this promise should be sufficient, but one might ask
why to "own" gold if all you rely on is a promise after all. Crypto is always
liquid internet money. As long as you have access to your private keys you
should be able to sell your digital assets 24/7 for anything that trades against
it. We could argue that another form of liquidity is portability. You cannot
just move your house or your gold bars across borders. You may not even be able
to redeem your gold shares if you end up in the wrong jurisdiction. What you can
always do is to backup and move your private keys, wherever you go. The next
dimension would be durability. Real estate is not very durable in the grand
scheme of things. Every house needs a new roof every once in a while. Real
estate has to be maintained over time, which might as well end up being a real
headache if you run out of luck. Gold is a precious metal and most durable by
nature. So gold gets a 20/20 on durability, if you own the physical. Blockchain
networks are not as lindy as gold. In fact, cryptography has to prove itself
time and time again as technology progresses. Though on that note, it would
probably be hubris to bet against technological progress. And your private keys
are not more than bits and bytes that can be remembered forever. The economic
value stored in association with your private keys fluctuates heavily based on
today's liquidity cycles. But the more important secular trend inherent to
blockchain networks is their technological adoption over time. Adoption of
blockchain networks has, and continues to increase rapidly, making their native
tokens ever more valuable as described by [Metcalfe's law]. Digital assets
underpin their own digital economies, and that makes them extremely valuable.
Our third dimension to consider is corruption, most notoriously known and
experienced by every single human being ever. [If you want to test a man’s
character, give him power.] And so, real estate has been seized, gold has been
banned, and to this day it remains uncertain how blockchain networks are going
to be corrupted from without and from within. [Removing machine learning from
your toolbox represents the lack of competitive advantage that no nation state
can do without anymore on the geopolitical stage], and the same is true for
blockchain networks. I argue that nation states cannot simply ban crypto
anymore. If they do, they fall behind, because the time has come that we vote
with our capital. If you are against us, you are without our money. One day
career politicians assemble an anti crypto army. And the next day they want to
work with us because they realized that over 50 million Americans own crypto. It
has never been clearer to anyone who is willing to listen that we, crypto as an
industry, won the game. And yet, if you talk to anyone outside of this industry,
you are still met with utter disbelieve. The opportunities in front of us are
barely understood by anyone and if you talk about our collective future vision,
you are still perceived as a delusional fool. The more they ignore us, the more
time we have to get embedded into the system. And I think that we already
crossed an existential tipping point, that gave crypto a cultural and
systemically critical relevance. We showed the world how to build systems that
cannot be easily corrupted. And if we only keep building these systems, we can
only keep winning to everyone's benefit.

If time is the ultimate end boss, we could say that future proof assets obtain
an inherent hardness. And if we believe that software is eating the world, then
we have to realize that the economy will become ever more digital. I believe the
world economy will eventually run on blockchain rails for a myriad of reasons.
Crypto does already get the adoption bid. Crypto does also already get the
liquidity bid today. If our theory is true, then crypto will eventually get the
demand bid in a future in which the world economy will run on blockchain rails.
