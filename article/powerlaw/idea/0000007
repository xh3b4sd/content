![diagram](./assets/0000007.1.svg)

We live in a society in which almost everything is about money. And as with
everything, money exists on a quality distribution. Not every money is created
equal. Some money is better than others. We refer to the quality of money as
hardness. That the best money is therefore the hardest possible asset. This post
intents to explain why hardness matters in the context of money.

Hardness is not just a proxy for quality.


the laws of physics have unbelievable hardness


exploitation, dillution, manipulation, consequences


the hardest assets bear the lowest risks

the hardest assets are the most durable, most reliable over long periods of time

the hardest assets cannot be corrupted
