This life, and everything within, can be very complicated and confusing. We live
in a world of random walks and uncertainty. Humans strive for knowledge and
control, whether in private, in business or in finance. And it takes a brave
heart to realize, that the more you know, the more you understand how much you
do, in fact, not know after all. Success is the search for truth. And this post
intends to explain what is always true.
