# SPORT OF KINGS

There are few things as fundamental to reality as information, behaviour and
value. We live in a money based society. And that means the fundamental aspect
of value, the money, makes the world go round. The struggle for value causes
information to change behaviour. So much so that we lose our self, our value and
eventually, our life. This post intents to explain how not to lose yourself
amidst the struggle for value.

There are only very few dynasties that we can reliably trace back to their
origins, hundreds or maybe thousands of years ago. The reason why we can trace
any of them back is because somehow the members involved achieved the
unparalleled feat of solving the coordination challenge of retaining value over
time. They did not stop. They did not die. They, [carry the fire]. Most family
trees normalize around forgetting and moving on. Most people stop carrying the
fire eventually. Because [the hardest thing is time itself].




[Simplicity requires knowledge]. The knowledge to understand all the few moving
parts defining the problem at hand. If you do not know where the yield comes
from, then two things must be true, both of which might kill you. First, there
is some inherent risk potential you cannot quantify, and when you cannot
quantify risk, then the safest assumption is to assume the highest risk
possible. Second, you might as well be the yield, meaning you have not much to
gain because somebody else makes a profit off your back.



The sport of kings is framed by us as the act of personal wealth creation and
wealth maintenance. This process can be described in binary outcomes. You either
survive or you don't. The masters of this craft survive in big ways, with a lot
of value, over long periods of time.


what are your goals?

what is your time horizon?

how bad do you really want this?

success is a lifestyle


the competition winning more than you hurts even if you are up bigly

sea change awareness, secular cycles

where are we in the cycle

the hardest part is often to do nothing

the extend of your networth dictates the available strategies to manage it
