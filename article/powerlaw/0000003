There are few things as fundamental to reality than information, behaviour and
value. We live in a money based society. And that means the fundamental aspect
of value, the money, makes the world go round. The struggle for value causes
information to change our behaviour. So much so that we lose our self, our value
and eventually, our life. This post intents to explain how not to die admidst
the struggle for value.

There are only very few dynasties that we can reliably trace back to their
origins, hundreds of years ago. The reason why we can trace any of them back is
because somehow the members involved achieved the unparalleled feat of solving
the coordination challenge of retaining value over time. They did not stop. They
did not die. They, [carry the fire]. Most family trees normalize around
forgetting and moving on. They stop carrying one fire, and maybe they pick up
another one, until this new fire is not carried anymore as well eventually.
