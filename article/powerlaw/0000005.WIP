# RESET EVERYTHING

Talk to anyone out there and you may come to the same conclusion. The systems
governing us all around the world are broken. Software breaks every day. And
when it breaks, we fix it. What we are somehow not fixing are the systems that
define how we live. The games we are playing collectively can only ever be as
good as the rules that tell us what we can do and what we cannot do. This post
intents to describe ideas for better games on a nation state level.


A Opportunities versus outcomes ,

We might say that opportunities get us towards capitalism and outcomes get us
towards communism.

opportunities are created for a broad set of personas
by applying a simple rule, outcomes are created for specific people by applying
a complucated idealogy,

No matter which system you choose you always will have competition and the
question you should be asking is on which level we should be wanting to compete
against ... yeah well, against who actually?


bigger government implies less competent citizens, and that is not good, less
competitive, less revenue, less profit, less growth, more dependence, more
centralization, less constraints


the constraints are defined between government and citizens, even though we want
to optimize for the health of the system, if the system is the objective, it
cannot be the constraint, and what actually matters is that the people do well


insert Margaret Thatcher quote, Socialist governments traditionally do make a
financial mess. They always run out of other people's money.


emergent behaviour versus enshrined opinions
