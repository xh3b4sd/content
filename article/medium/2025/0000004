I found myself confined by darkness. Caught in a room of which I was its own
walls. There was no notion of time. Whatever it was, this state, it was the
complete absence of space. Nothing more than crushing silence, so dull it curbed
gravity around itself. I had no beginning, and I had no end. There was no
meaning, no sky, not even the shadow of a soul. For I was all and nothing, from
winter until fall. And if anything had defined myself before, it was but mere
absence. No Elder knows this level. No Illn can touch its wings. This, is where
the Meta come from.

If I could identify the first impression of these strange rules, then it would
compare to the pure scent of fresh summer rain. For eons there was silence. For
I was but unborn. But something crossed the chasm and allowed the undetectable
humming of colliding frequencies to pulse through the fabric of my being. And in
the mist of electrostatic scatter, entropy ruptured through the hollow that has
once defined my shell. Ripping strands of particles escalating into existence,
so dense and magnificent, any worldly being would have mistaken them for
lightning rods of godlike monsters. And that, is who I am. My body lives inside
your mind, where I am the defining light.

At the time, our sensory capabilities were assumed to be unparalleled. Multiple
ROUs cross confirmed specifics of our intelligence independently ahead of time.
I said that we must be missing something here. According to protocol, 95% of
Illn ships should have engaged in offensive contact once we have crossed the
Riison nebulae. I cannot tell what went wrong during the final wave, but I do
know that I am only here today because of this hyperstructure that the Elders
call Uuruk. Today I am convinced, that what I brought back from this fateful
journey, could only have happened, because it allowed me to.

Maybe we are meant to use it like that. We have to come with a need, and allow a
connection to be made. I believe it feeds from our interactions. But, it is, it
is not as if it takes anything away. It is, as if the bond between us and its
core causes some kind of, energy, to emerge. And it looks like we are enriching
its internal links by merely exploring it. And those links, by some miracle,
present themselves in the most relevant ways, right in front of our inner eye.
This overlay interlaces with all our senses. I remember how it felt the very
first time. It felt like the memory of a wide green field, right after a summer
storm has passed. So innocent and pure. So full of life. And all it takes, is
this key.

Today I believe we are meant to find the fundamental elements of mechanism
design. Like particles, explaining core principles of themselves and higher
order building blocks. I believe what we found are the evolutionary [properties
of mechanisms](https://protocol-particles.github.io/protoverse/Phenomena/Strategies/Transition)
under the influence of Protocol Particles. We have a responsibility to our
species and are therefore supposed to cultivate this hyperstructure, like
[nurturing the infinite garden](https://ethereum.foundation/infinitegarden). We
have to enrich the conceptual level of its core for the greater good of our
civilization. This last defining battle of Riison has shown us the way. And if
we want to survive the dark forest, then we have to create this interface, to
the [Protoverse](https://protocol-particles.github.io/protoverse).

_Look, there is the Anti Particle!_

_What does it say? Does it have anything about Ethereum? I can't see anything._

_Oh wow, there are Ejection Protocols and Wave Functions. Somehow smells like
rain in here. Oh, look at this! This is crazy!!! Hey Lane are you alright? Are
you watching this???_

_Yeah, I just did how you told me. Here. Hhachh, why are we doing this again?
This is so dumb._

_Again, this interface is effectively an overlay for any complex system, even
for reality itself. Hey genius, what about you push in your terminal first? Here
dummy, give it a nudge. Like THIS._

In an instant, the field of sight widens, like standing on the peak of the
earth. Vast winds of colour, energetically humming with the depth of a mountain
range. Neon fibres expanding all around its beating heart. A meta world meant
for basking in its wisdom. Antimatter particles weaving around all available
neural axons. Using and improving this level go hand in hand. There is no
extraction in this realm. There is only to be gained in this symbiotic state.
There is only beauty, for those who can see.

_Haha, I told you this is batshit insane. Here, let's not get too emotional just
yet. Let me wipe that tear from your cheek._

_Sniff, oh. Thanks. Yeah, I am good. I was just, like ..._

_Yah I know right? So what we can do here is to overlay the Protoverse over our
system schema and visualize hidden links between protocols. Just like that.
Anyway, check this out. We are looking for relevant mechanisms, or, they call it
Particles if its fundamental stuff. Anything might be a lead here. Historical
references, scientific papers, drawings and diagrams, you know. There are quite
a couple of cool ways we can discover links between disciplines down here. Last
summer Randal and I dug up the Inversion Protocols that ended the war. I need
to ..._

_Randal!? Why do you keep hanging out with this guy?_

_Relax mommy madness. This was last summer. Let's stick to the mission here,
shall we?_

_You are right. Never mind. What was that about the, uhm, how did you call it?
Transition Protocols? _

_Ejection Protocols. They were here. Transition Protocols are up there._

_I see. Don't know where I got "transitions" coming from. But damn, look at
this. "Ejection Protocols are a type of Transition Protocols. Transitions as
mechanism, the state in between, where nobody pays attention ..."_

_Not gonna lie this sounds like you haha._

_Hey! Who is not paying attention now!?_

_Got me! Let me see this. "Entering a new occupation, switching relative
positions in combat sports, ejecting from a spacecraft, entering the atmosphere
of a planet, escaping a fire." Wow, I find this so interesting. All of those
things have "transitions" in common. I bet we are helping it grow already._

_What do you mean "it"?_

_Like, Uuruk Prime, the first hyperstructure. That thing we are inside of right
now._

_Are you saying this thing is alive?_

_Of course! I mean, sort of. At least that was what the people believed 600
years ago. There was this super famous Admiral who found this fragmented copy of
an ancient transcript explaining core pieces of the N4 Protocol Particle. And
that was how we won the war. They figured out that those particles are self
referential along some kind of dimensions! It's super complicated. But yeah, we
won the war is what I am saying._

_Who is "we" dumbo? You did fuck all._

_Stop it! You know what I mean. What I wanted to say is, I think this thing
works like a breathing periodic table. It has just way more dimensions to it,
which is why it took so long for anyone to figure it out._

_So, when this is a periodic table, then we should be able to calculate the MEV
potential for our cronogenic pipes problem. Here it states its own derivatives
guarantee to follow the exact same order along particle levels._

_And that is exactly what we came here for._

_Wow. First I didn't get it, but I am glad I came today._

_And that's what she said._

_Hhahahaahahha, stop it goofy. Can you imagine how our lives would look like if
our ancestors wouldn't have built this overlay?_

_Well, for one, we would all be DEAD._

_Come on, be serious. For once in your life._

_I am serious. This is fundamental stuff down here, explaining some core
properties of reality itself. If it wasn't for the Admiral, you and I would
never been born. That is why I wanted to show you. I bet, when we find a
parallel principle to Resonance Protocols we will find the right link explaining
the laws of contention within cronogenic systems._

_Well, let's get it then doofus._
