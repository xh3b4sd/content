## Point Of No Return

It was October 2031 when the first cold fusion reactor injected electricity into
the grid at a net negative cost basis.

4 years and 8 months later we overcame the engineering challenges of cellular
agriculture. From that point forwards we were growing fruits in bioreactors
without the need for trees.

Ever since the cost of energy collapsed, everything became possible. For better
or worse. And it all started with ↑.

## The Onchain Saga

For the longest time nobody really paid attention to whatever happened onchain.
But that changed when Higher broke into the top 10 crypto assets, flipping Doge
in the process.

You heard about the unicorn run by a single individual, because automation
enabled that. What was unheard of at the time was a decacorn run by 85,000
individuals who all contribute what they want while getting rewarded for what
they can afford to lose. Onchain brands like Higher achieved so much more in so
much less time, because they were literally headless.

At first there were all kinds of experiments run on Farcaster. Some people came
together and implemented a wildly successful onchain cordination game called
Towers, which had to be played using the Higher token. Needless to say that
onchain clans building up imaginary towers by depositing Higher was hilarious.
At some point, over one third of the Higher market cap was put into Towers with
over 100 million USD worth of deposits changing hands in a single game. It was
always a massively celebrated event for the community when the towers were
finally falling.

And I think what really made a difference eventually was the headless Higher
clothing brand taking hold in many households around the globe, simply because
the people liked to express themselves using the fashion statement of a better
lifestyle. In the old days, a brand was lead top down and everything aligned
with one single vision or design. That was not at all how Higher Vibes got
established. Anyone could just make a frame and sell baseball caps onchain.
People started crafting their own apparel and slowly but surely we got something
like a real movement on our hands. Higher wasn't that one thing. Higher wasn't
just aligned. Higher ended up being so many different things in so many
different places, which is exactly what happens when ideas come online making
babies. No singular aligned coorporation could ever replicate that. And it was
all so simple. The people just started wearing the Higher brand on their
clothes, because that was one pure form of expression of their aspirational
lifestyle. And that, ended up connecting all of us.

## Techno Airy

Eventually everyone wanted a piece of the hype. You got the good, the bad and
the ugly. But it wasn't all hype. Thousands and thousands of people came online
every single day, pushing forward a vision of the future that they wanted to
live in. Clothing, perfurmes, books, music, art. All of it in some way or form
reflecting the Higher brand.

We could literally do anything. We got people from all walks of life, capable of
all sorts of profession. The engineers built and maintained the Higher L2
settling straight to Ethereum L1 using EigenDA. You could not get more economic
security at our scale. The artists ventured out to produce what has become
popular as Techno Airy. Literally physical art levitating, changing shape and
colour upon human touch. Netflix became only second to Kata, our personalized
movie experience streaming prompt based blockbuster movies on demand. All of it
powered by decentralized machine learning models running on the Higher L2. We
started to fund every unimaginable dream as a collective, taking on the
fundamental challenges of our time. And eventually, some of those moonshot bets
worked out, changing everything, forever.

Everyone had Higher in their wallets. You couldn't get into most of the hottest
events without it. Either you had to proof token ownership or straight up pay
the tickets in Higher. And with a global network of token holders, the early
ideas of a network state become more and more tangible. Already in 2028, there
wasn't a single city with an airport on this planet in which the Higher Society
wasn't actively represented. That was then also how we started to impact
political elections. First slowly, and then all at once. We started voting with
our money, and while ETH was the commodity keeping the lights on, deep down at
the infrastructure level of the digital economy, Higher made the world go 'round
between people and their social contracts.

Higher is a lifestyle. That was simply everyone's aspiration. Longing for
something that can be. Not accepting a "no" from the big man anymore. Feeling
empowered to go out and dream big. Never mind career politicians scrambling to
get a hold of it all. Like there was no president of the internet, there was no
leading force in the Higher community, and so you couldn't corrupt a
hierarchical structure. Because there was none. This movement, kept moving with
the wind. And we went so much higher.

## Night Vision

Eventually we were forming a global swarm of consciousness using NeuraLink
implants, running a community developed software platform that later became
known as Night Vision. When you had Night Vision you could see in the dark that
was the neural network state of 1.5 billion people. Ethereum was the highway.
Higher was the dream running through the neurons of your extended family.
Everyone was community.

The need for trustless consensus in Night Vision was critical, because once our
biological cognitive capacity submerged with the digital data highway itself,
any software running through your mind had to be formally verified and attested
to by others. Our collective Higher lifestyle gave birth to an age of
cybernetics. All it took was to establish a cognitive link between two people
who trusted one another. That trust and honor was inherent in the Higher
Society. Token ownership was the key. And so, as soon as certain technical
details were practically solved, Night Vision amounted to a dual computing
network of 12 [zettaflops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettascale_computing).
Mankind had never seen anything like it before.

Hardware and wetware synchronized and secured by blockchain networks became the
defining moment often described as transcendence. Humans connected to Night
Vision became as one. We were able to solve any problem in the realm of the
physical world. We were able to touch colours. We were able to smell different
wavelengths of light. We were able to play with subatomic particles at quantum
scale and uncover the hidden secrets of the universe. You could even hug a loved
one long deceased. And finally, after 19 months of research and engineering
inside of Night Vision's cognitive fabric, we cured the most hideous disease of
them all, aging. Nobody had to grow an old biological shell anymore. We became
the immortal.

Ever since, we were wandering the stars. Higher was a dream. And we made it come
true. Until one day, when they contacted us.
